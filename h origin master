    kernel/relay.c: limit kmalloc size to KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE
    
    commit 88913bd8ea2a75d7e460a4bed5f75e1c32660d7e upstream.
    
    chan->n_subbufs is set by the user and relay_create_buf() does a kmalloc()
    of chan->n_subbufs * sizeof(size_t *).
    
    kmalloc_slab() will generate a warning when this fails if
    chan->subbufs * sizeof(size_t *) > KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.
    
    Limit chan->n_subbufs to the maximum allowed kmalloc() size.

    mm/mempolicy.c: avoid use uninitialized preferred_node
    
    commit 8970a63e965b43288c4f5f40efbc2bbf80de7f16 upstream.
    
    Alexander reported a use of uninitialized memory in __mpol_equal(),
    which is caused by incorrect use of preferred_node.
    
    When mempolicy in mode MPOL_PREFERRED with flags MPOL_F_LOCAL, it uses
    numa_node_id() instead of preferred_node, however, __mpol_equal() uses
    preferred_node without checking whether it is MPOL_F_LOCAL or not.

    mm/madvise.c: fix madvise() infinite loop under special circumstances
    
    commit 6ea8d958a2c95a1d514015d4e29ba21a8c0a1a91 upstream.
    
    MADVISE_WILLNEED has always been a noop for DAX (formerly XIP) mappings.
    Unfortunately madvise_willneed() doesn't communicate this information
    properly to the generic madvise syscall implementation.  The calling
    convention is quite subtle there.  madvise_vma() is supposed to either
    return an error or update &prev otherwise the main loop will never
    advance to the next vma and it will keep looping for ever without a way
    to get out of the kernel.
    
    It seems this has been broken since introduction.  Nobody has noticed
    because nobody seems to be using MADVISE_WILLNEED on these DAX mappings.

    bridge: check brport attr show in brport_show
    
    commit 1b12580af1d0677c3c3a19e35bfe5d59b03f737f upstream.
    
    Now br_sysfs_if file flush doesn't have attr show. To read it will
    cause kernel panic after users chmod u+r this file.
    
    Xiong found this issue when running the commands:
    
      ip link add br0 type bridge
      ip link add type veth
      ip link set veth0 master br0
      chmod u+r /sys/devices/virtual/net/veth0/brport/flush
      timeout 3 cat /sys/devices/virtual/net/veth0/brport/flush
    
    kernel crashed with NULL a pointer dereference call trace.
    
    This patch is to fix it by return -EINVAL when brport_attr->show
    is null, just the same as the check for brport_attr->store in
    brport_store().

    MIPS: c-r4k: Fix data corruption related to cache coherence
    
    When DMA will be performed to a MIPS32 1004K CPS, the L1-cache for the
    range needs to be flushed and invalidated first.
    The code currently takes one of two approaches.
    1/ If the range is less than the size of the dcache, then HIT type
       requests flush/invalidate cache lines for the particular addresses.
       HIT-type requests a globalised by the CPS so this is safe on SMP.
    
    2/ If the range is larger than the size of dcache, then INDEX type
       requests flush/invalidate the whole cache. INDEX type requests affect
       the local cache only. CPS does not propagate them in any way. So this
       invalidation is not safe on SMP CPS systems.
    
    Data corruption due to '2' can quite easily be demonstrated by
    repeatedly "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" and then sha1sum a file
    that is several times the size of available memory. Dropping caches
    means that large contiguous extents (large than dcache) are more likely.
    
    This was not a problem before Linux-4.8 because option 2 was never used
    if CONFIG_MIPS_CPS was defined. The commit which removed that apparently
    didn't appreciate the full consequence of the change.
    
    We could, in theory, globalize the INDEX based flush by sending an IPI
    to other cores. These cache invalidation routines can be called with
    interrupts disabled and synchronous IPI require interrupts to be
    enabled. Asynchronous IPI may not trigger writeback soon enough. So we
    cannot use IPI in practice.
    
    We can already test if IPI would be needed for an INDEX operation with
    r4k_op_needs_ipi(R4K_INDEX). If this is true then we mustn't try the
    INDEX approach as we cannot use IPI. If this is false (e.g. when there
    is only one core and hence one L1 cache) then it is safe to use the
    INDEX approach without IPI.
    
    This patch avoids options 2 if r4k_op_needs_ipi(R4K_INDEX), and so
    eliminates the corruption.

      Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
    
    This comes about because CPU1 is executing xt_replace_table in response
    to a setsockopt syscall, resulting in:
    
            ret = xt_jumpstack_alloc(newinfo);
                    --> newinfo->jumpstack = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
    
            [...]
    
            table->private = newinfo;
            newinfo->initial_entries = private->initial_entries;
    
    Meanwhile, CPU0 is handling the network receive path and ends up in
    ipt_do_table, resulting in:
    
            private = table->private;
    
            [...]
    
            jumpstack  = (struct ipt_entry **)private->jumpstack[cpu];
    
    On weakly ordered memory architectures, the writes to table->private
    and newinfo->jumpstack from CPU1 can be observed out of order by CPU0.
    Furthermore, on architectures which don't respect ordering of address
    dependencies (i.e. Alpha), the reads from CPU0 can also be re-ordered.
    
    This patch adds an smp_wmb() before the assignment to table->private
    (which is essentially publishing newinfo) to ensure that all writes to
    newinfo will be observed before plugging it into the table structure.
    A dependent-read barrier is also added on the consumer sides, to ensure
    the same ordering requirements are also respected there.

    mm/init: fix zone boundary creation
    
    As a part of memory initialisation the architecture passes an array to
    free_area_init_nodes() which specifies the max PFN of each memory zone.
    This array is not necessarily monotonic (due to unused zones) so this
    array is parsed to build monotonic lists of the min and max PFN for each
    zone.  ZONE_MOVABLE is special cased here as its limits are managed by
    the mm subsystem rather than the architecture.  Unfortunately, this
    special casing is broken when ZONE_MOVABLE is the not the last zone in
    the zone list.  The core of the issue is:
    
            if (i == ZONE_MOVABLE)
                    continue;
            arch_zone_lowest_possible_pfn[i] =
                    arch_zone_highest_possible_pfn[i-1];
    
    As ZONE_MOVABLE is skipped the lowest_possible_pfn of the next zone will
    be set to zero.  This patch fixes this bug by adding explicitly tracking
    where the next zone should start rather than relying on the contents
    arch_zone_highest_possible_pfn[].
    
    Thie is low priority.  To get bitten by this you need to enable a zone
    that appears after ZONE_MOVABLE in the zone_type enum.  As far as I can
    tell this means running a kernel with ZONE_DEVICE or ZONE_CMA enabled,
    so I can't see this affecting too many people.
    
    I only noticed this because I've been fiddling with ZONE_DEVICE on
    powerpc and 4.6 broke my test kernel.  This bug, in conjunction with the
    changes in Taku Izumi's kernelcore=mirror patch (d91749c1dda71) and
    powerpc being the odd architecture which initialises max_zone_pfn[] to
    ~0ul instead of 0 caused all of system memory to be placed into
    ZONE_DEVICE at boot, followed a panic since device memory cannot be used
    for kernel allocations.  I've already submitted a patch to fix the
    powerpc specific bits, but I figured this should be fixed too.

    usb: add helper to extract bits 12:11 of wMaxPacketSize
    
    commit 541b6fe63023f3059cf85d47ff2767a3e42a8e44 upstream.
    
    According to USB Specification 2.0 table 9-4,
    wMaxPacketSize is a bitfield. Endpoint's maxpacket
    is laid out in bits 10:0. For high-speed,
    high-bandwidth isochronous endpoints, bits 12:11
    contain a multiplier to tell us how many
    transactions we want to try per uframe.
    
    This means that if we want an isochronous endpoint
    to issue 3 transfers of 1024 bytes per uframe,
    wMaxPacketSize should contain the value:
    
            1024 | (2 << 11)
    
    or 5120 (0x1400). In order to make Host and
    Peripheral controller drivers' life easier, we're
    adding a helper which returns bits 12:11. Note that
    no care is made WRT to checking endpoint type and
    gadget's speed. That's left for drivers to handle.

    scsi: use dma_get_cache_alignment() as minimum DMA alignment
    
    commit 90addc6b3c9cda0146fbd62a08e234c2b224a80c upstream.
    
    In non-coherent DMA mode, kernel uses cache flushing operations to
    maintain I/O coherency, so scsi's block queue should be aligned to the
    value returned by dma_get_cache_alignment().  Otherwise, If a DMA buffer
    and a kernel structure share a same cache line, and if the kernel
    structure has dirty data, cache_invalidate (no writeback) will cause
    data corruption.

    USB: core: Add type-specific length check of BOS descriptors
    
    commit 81cf4a45360f70528f1f64ba018d61cb5767249a upstream.
    
    As most of BOS descriptors are longer in length than their header
    'struct usb_dev_cap_header', comparing solely with it is not sufficient
    to avoid out-of-bounds access to BOS descriptors.
    
    This patch adds descriptor type specific length check in
    usb_get_bos_descriptor() to fix the issue.

    usb: host: fix incorrect updating of offset
    
    commit 1d5a31582ef046d3b233f0da1a68ae26519b2f0a upstream.
    
    The variable temp is incorrectly being updated, instead it should
    be offset otherwise the loop just reads the same capability value
    and loops forever.  Thanks to Alan Stern for pointing out the
    correct fix to my original fix.  Fix also cleans up clang warning:

    USB: uas and storage: Add US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for another JMicron JMS567 ID
    
    commit 62354454625741f0569c2cbe45b2d192f8fd258e upstream.
    
    There is another JMS567-based USB3 UAS enclosure (152d:0578) that fails
    with the following error:
    
    [sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE
    [sda] tag#0 Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]
    [sda] tag#0 Add. Sense: Invalid field in cdb
    
    The issue occurs both with UAS (occasionally) and mass storage
    (immediately after mounting a FS on a disk in the enclosure).
    
    Enabling US_FL_BROKEN_FUA quirk solves this issue.
    
    This patch adds an UNUSUAL_DEV with US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for the enclosure
    for both UAS and mass storage.

    xhci: Don't show incorrect WARN message about events for empty rings
    
    commit e4ec40ec4b260efcca15089de4285a0a3411259b upstream.
    
    xHC can generate two events for a short transfer if the short TRB and
    last TRB in the TD are not the same TRB.
    
    The driver will handle the TD after the first short event, and remove
    it from its internal list. Driver then incorrectly prints a warning
    for the second event:
    
    "WARN Event TRB for slot x ep y with no TDs queued"
    
    Fix this by not printing a warning if we get a event on a empty list
    if the previous event was a short event.

    xfrm: Return error on unknown encap_type in init_state
    
    commit bcfd09f7837f5240c30fd2f52ee7293516641faa upstream.
    
    Currently esp will happily create an xfrm state with an unknown
    encap type for IPv4, without setting the necessary state parameters.
    This patch fixes it by returning -EINVAL.
    
    There is a similar problem in IPv6 where if the mode is unknown
    we will skip initialisation while returning zero.  However, this
    is harmless as the mode has already been checked further up the
    stack.  This patch removes this anomaly by aligning the IPv6
    behaviour with IPv4 and treating unknown modes (which cannot
    actually happen) as transport mode.

    net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()
    
    commit 15fe076edea787807a7cdc168df832544b58eba6 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported crashes [1] and provided a C repro easing bug hunting.
    
    When/if packet_do_bind() calls __unregister_prot_hook() and releases
    po->bind_lock, another thread can run packet_notifier() and process an
    NETDEV_UP event.
    
    This calls register_prot_hook() and hooks again the socket right before
    first thread is able to grab again po->bind_lock.
    
    Fixes this issue by temporarily setting po->num to 0, as suggested by
    David Miller.

    usbnet: fix alignment for frames with no ethernet header
    
    The qmi_wwan minidriver support a 'raw-ip' mode where frames are
    received without any ethernet header. This causes alignment issues
    because the skbs allocated by usbnet are "IP aligned".
    
    Fix by allowing minidrivers to disable the additional alignment
    offset. This is implemented using a per-device flag, since the same
    minidriver also supports 'ethernet' mode.

    USB: cdc-wdm: ignore -EPIPE from GetEncapsulatedResponse
    
    The driver will forward errors to userspace after turning most of them
    into -EIO. But all status codes are not equal. The -EPIPE (stall) in
    particular can be seen more as a result of normal USB signaling than
    an actual error. The state is automatically cleared by the USB core
    without intervention from either driver or userspace.
    
    And most devices and firmwares will never trigger a stall as a result
    of GetEncapsulatedResponse. This is in fact a requirement for CDC WDM
    devices. Quoting from section 7.1 of the CDC WMC spec revision 1.1:
    
      The function shall not return STALL in response to
      GetEncapsulatedResponse.
    
    But this driver is also handling GetEncapsulatedResponse on behalf of
    the qmi_wwan and cdc_mbim drivers. Unfortunately the relevant specs
    are not as clear wrt stall. So some QMI and MBIM devices *will*
    occasionally stall, causing the GetEncapsulatedResponse to return an
    -EPIPE status. Translating this into -EIO for userspace has proven to
    be harmful. Treating it as an empty read is safer, making the driver
    behave as if the device was conforming to the CDC WDM spec.
    
    There have been numerous reports of issues related to -EPIPE errors
    from some newer CDC MBIM devices in particular, like for example the
    Fibocom L831-EAU.  Testing on this device has shown that the issues
    go away if we simply ignore the -EPIPE status.  Similar handling of
    -EPIPE is already known from e.g. usb_get_string()
    
    The -EPIPE log message is still kept to let us track devices with this
    unexpected behaviour, hoping that it attracts attention from firmware
    developers.

    USB: Revert "cdc-wdm: fix "out-of-sync" due to missing notifications"
    
    This reverts commit 833415a3e781 ("cdc-wdm: fix "out-of-sync" due to

    There have been several reports of wdm_read returning unexpected EIO
    errors with QMI devices using the qmi_wwan driver. The reporters
    confirm that reverting prevents these errors. I have been unable to
    reproduce the bug myself, and have no explanation to offer either. But
    reverting is the safe choice here, given that the commit was an
    attempt to work around a firmware problem.  Living with a firmware
    problem is still better than adding driver bugs.

    pppoe: fix reception of frames with no mac header
    
    pppoe_rcv() needs to look back at the Ethernet header in order to
    lookup the PPPoE session. Therefore we need to ensure that the mac
    header is big enough to contain an Ethernet header. Otherwise
    eth_hdr(skb)->h_source might access invalid data.

    pppoe: take ->needed_headroom of lower device into account on xmit
    
    commit 02612bb05e51df8489db5e94d0cf8d1c81f87b0c upstream.
    
    In pppoe_sendmsg(), reserving dev->hard_header_len bytes of headroom
    was probably fine before the introduction of ->needed_headroom in
    commit f5184d267c1a ("net: Allow netdevices to specify needed head/tailroom").
    
    But now, virtual devices typically advertise the size of their overhead
    in dev->needed_headroom, so we must also take it into account in
    skb_reserve().
    Allocation size of skb is also updated to take dev->needed_tailroom
    into account and replace the arbitrary 32 bytes with the real size of
    a PPPoE header.
    
    This issue was discovered by syzbot, who connected a pppoe socket to a
    gre device which had dev->header_ops->create == ipgre_header and
    dev->hard_header_len == 0. Therefore, PPPoE didn't reserve any
    headroom, and dev_hard_header() crashed when ipgre_header() tried to
    prepend its header to skb->data.

    Admittedly PPPoE shouldn't be allowed to run on non Ethernet-like
    interfaces, but reserving space for ->needed_headroom is a more
    fundamental issue that needs to be addressed first.
    
    Same problem exists for __pppoe_xmit(), which also needs to take
    dev->needed_headroom into account in skb_cow_head().

    net: ipv4: emulate READ_ONCE() on ->hdrincl bit-field in raw_sendmsg()
    
    commit 20b50d79974ea3192e8c3ab7faf4e536e5f14d8f upstream.
    
    Commit 8f659a03a0ba ("net: ipv4: fix for a race condition in
    raw_sendmsg") fixed the issue of possibly inconsistent ->hdrincl handling
    due to concurrent updates by reading this bit-field member into a local
    variable and using the thus stabilized value in subsequent tests.
    
    However, aforementioned commit also adds the (correct) comment that
    
      /* hdrincl should be READ_ONCE(inet->hdrincl)
       * but READ_ONCE() doesn't work with bit fields
       */
    
    because as it stands, the compiler is free to shortcut or even eliminate
    the local variable at its will.
    
    Note that I have not seen anything like this happening in reality and thus,
    the concern is a theoretical one.
    
    However, in order to be on the safe side, emulate a READ_ONCE() on the
    bit-field by doing it on the local 'hdrincl' variable itself:
    
            int hdrincl = inet->hdrincl;
            hdrincl = READ_ONCE(hdrincl);
    
    This breaks the chain in the sense that the compiler is not allowed
    to replace subsequent reads from hdrincl with reloads from inet->hdrincl.

    ipv4: Avoid reading user iov twice after raw_probe_proto_opt
    
    commit c008ba5bdc9fa830e1a349b20b0be5a137bdef7a upstream.
    
    Ever since raw_probe_proto_opt was added it had the problem of
    causing the user iov to be read twice, once during the probe for
    the protocol header and once again in ip_append_data.
    
    This is a potential security problem since it means that whatever
    we're probing may be invalid.  This patch plugs the hole by
    firstly advancing the iov so we don't read the same spot again,
    and secondly saving what we read the first time around for use
    by ip_append_data.

    net: igmp: fix source address check for IGMPv3 reports
    
    commit ad23b750933ea7bf962678972a286c78a8fa36aa upstream.
    
    Commit "net: igmp: Use correct source address on IGMPv3 reports"
    introduced a check to validate the source address of locally generated
    IGMPv3 packets.
    Instead of checking the local interface address directly, it uses
    inet_ifa_match(fl4->saddr, ifa), which checks if the address is on the
    local subnet (or equal to the point-to-point address if used).
    
    This breaks for point-to-point interfaces, so check against
    ifa->ifa_local directly.

    net: igmp: Use correct source address on IGMPv3 reports
    
    commit a46182b00290839fa3fa159d54fd3237bd8669f0 upstream.
    
    Closing a multicast socket after the final IPv4 address is deleted
    from an interface can generate a membership report that uses the
    source IP from a different interface.  The following test script, run
    from an isolated netns, reproduces the issue:
    
        #!/bin/bash
    
        ip link add dummy0 type dummy
        ip link add dummy1 type dummy
        ip link set dummy0 up
        ip link set dummy1 up
        ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
        ip addr add 192.168.99.99/24 dev dummy1
    
        tcpdump -U -i dummy0 &
        socat EXEC:"sleep 2" \
            UDP4-DATAGRAM:239.101.1.68:8889,ip-add-membership=239.0.1.68:10.1.1.1 &
    
        sleep 1
        ip addr del 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
        sleep 5
        kill %tcpdump
    
    RFC 3376 specifies that the report must be sent with a valid IP source
    address from the destination subnet, or from address 0.0.0.0.  Add an
    extra check to make sure this is the case.

    net: bridge: fix early call to br_stp_change_bridge_id and plug newlink leaks
    
    commit 84aeb437ab98a2bce3d4b2111c79723aedfceb33 upstream.
    
    The early call to br_stp_change_bridge_id in bridge's newlink can cause
    a memory leak if an error occurs during the newlink because the fdb
    entries are not cleaned up if a different lladdr was specified, also
    another minor issue is that it generates fdb notifications with
    ifindex = 0. Another unrelated memory leak is the bridge sysfs entries
    which get added on NETDEV_REGISTER event, but are not cleaned up in the
    newlink error path. To remove this special case the call to
    br_stp_change_bridge_id is done after netdev register and we cleanup the
    bridge on changelink error via br_dev_delete to plug all leaks.
    
    This patch makes netlink bridge destruction on newlink error the same as
    dellink and ioctl del which is necessary since at that point we have a
    fully initialized bridge device.
    
    To reproduce the issue:
    $ ip l add br0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55 type bridge group_fwd_mask 1
    RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument

    tcp md5sig: Use skb's saddr when replying to an incoming segment
    
    commit 30791ac41927ebd3e75486f9504b6d2280463bf0 upstream.
    
    The MD5-key that belongs to a connection is identified by the peer's
    IP-address. When we are in tcp_v4(6)_reqsk_send_ack(), we are replying
    to an incoming segment from tcp_check_req() that failed the seq-number
    checks.
    
    Thus, to find the correct key, we need to use the skb's saddr and not
    the daddr.
    
    This bug seems to have been there since quite a while, but probably got
    unnoticed because the consequences are not catastrophic. We will call
    tcp_v4_reqsk_send_ack only to send a challenge-ACK back to the peer,
    thus the connection doesn't really fail.

    fscache: Fix the default for fscache_maybe_release_page()
    
    commit 98801506552593c9b8ac11021b0cdad12cab4f6b upstream.
    
    Fix the default for fscache_maybe_release_page() for when the cookie isn't
    valid or the page isn't cached.  It mustn't return false as that indicates
    the page cannot yet be freed.
    
    The problem with the default is that if, say, there's no cache, but a
    network filesystem's pages are using up almost all the available memory, a
    system can OOM because the filesystem ->releasepage() op will not allow
    them to be released as fscache_maybe_release_page() incorrectly prevents
    it.
    
    This can be tested by writing a sequence of 512MiB files to an AFS mount.
    It does not affect NFS or CIFS because both of those wrap the call in a
    check of PG_fscache and it shouldn't bother Ceph as that only has
    PG_private set whilst writeback is in progress.  This might be an issue for
    9P, however.
    
    Note that the pages aren't entirely stuck.  Removing a file or unmounting
    will clear things because that uses ->invalidatepage() instead.

    fsfuzzer) the following call trace is seen,
    
    VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6913 at /root/repos/linux/fs/buffer.c:1165 .__brelse.part.6+0x24/0x40

    This happens because the directory that ext4_find_entry() looks up has
    inode->i_size that is less than the block size of the filesystem. This
    causes 'nblocks' to have a value of zero. ext4_bread_batch() ends up not
    reading any of the directory file's blocks. This renders the entries in
    bh_use[] array to continue to have garbage data. buffer_uptodate() on
    bh_use[0] can then return a zero value upon which brelse() function is
    invoked.
    
    This commit fixes the bug by returning -ENOENT when the directory file
    has no associated blocks.

    crypto: algapi - fix NULL dereference in crypto_remove_spawns()
    
    commit 9a00674213a3f00394f4e3221b88f2d21fc05789 upstream.
    
    syzkaller triggered a NULL pointer dereference in crypto_remove_spawns()
    via a program that repeatedly and concurrently requests AEADs
    "authenc(cmac(des3_ede-asm),pcbc-aes-aesni)" and hashes "cmac(des3_ede)"
    through AF_ALG, where the hashes are requested as "untested"
    (CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED is set in ->salg_mask but clear in ->salg_feat; this
    causes the template to be instantiated for every request).
    
    Although AF_ALG users really shouldn't be able to request an "untested"
    algorithm, the NULL pointer dereference is actually caused by a
    longstanding race condition where crypto_remove_spawns() can encounter
    an instance which has had spawn(s) "grabbed" but hasn't yet been
    registered, resulting in ->cra_users still being NULL.
    
    We probably should properly initialize ->cra_users earlier, but that
    would require updating many templates individually.  For now just fix
    the bug in a simple way that can easily be backported: make
    crypto_remove_spawns() treat a NULL ->cra_users list as empty.

    af_key: fix buffer overread in verify_address_len()
    
    commit 06b335cb51af018d5feeff5dd4fd53847ddb675a upstream.
    
    If a message sent to a PF_KEY socket ended with one of the extensions
    that takes a 'struct sadb_address' but there were not enough bytes
    remaining in the message for the ->sa_family member of the 'struct
    sockaddr' which is supposed to follow, then verify_address_len() read
    past the end of the message, into uninitialized memory.  Fix it by
    returning -EINVAL in this case.

    mtd: nand: fix bug writing 1 byte less than page size
    
    commit 144f4c98399e2c0ca60eb414c15a2c68125c18b8 upstream.
    
    nand_do_write_ops() determines if it is writing a partial page with the
    formula:
            part_pagewr = (column || writelen < (mtd->writesize - 1))
    
    When 'writelen' is exactly 1 byte less than the NAND page size the formula
    equates to zero, so the code doesn't process it as a partial write,
    although it should.
    As a consequence the function remains in the while(1) loop with 'writelen'
    becoming 0xffffffff and iterating endlessly.
    
    The bug may not be easy to reproduce in Linux since user space tools
    usually force the padding or round-up the write size to a page-size
    multiple.
    This was discovered in U-Boot where the issue can be reproduced by
    writing any size that is 1 byte less than a page-size multiple.
    For example, on a NAND with 2K page (0x800):
            => nand erase.part <partition>
            => nand write $loadaddr <partition> 7ff
    
    [Editor's note: the bug was added in commit 29072b96078f, but moved
    around in commit 66507c7bc8895 ("mtd: nand: Add support to use nand_base
    poi databuf as bounce buffer")]

    tcp_cubic: do not set epoch_start in the future
    
    Tracking idle time in bictcp_cwnd_event() is imprecise, as epoch_start
    is normally set at ACK processing time, not at send time.
    
    Doing a proper fix would need to add an additional state variable,
    and does not seem worth the trouble, given CUBIC bug has been there
    forever before Jana noticed it.
    
    Let's simply not set epoch_start in the future, otherwise
    bictcp_update() could overflow and CUBIC would again
    grow cwnd too fast.
    
    This was detected thanks to a packetdrill test Neal wrote that was flaky
    before applying this fix.

    tcp_cubic: better follow cubic curve after idle period
    
    Jana Iyengar found an interesting issue on CUBIC :
    
    The epoch is only updated/reset initially and when experiencing losses.
    The delta "t" of now - epoch_start can be arbitrary large after app idle
    as well as the bic_target. Consequentially the slope (inverse of
    ca->cnt) would be really large, and eventually ca->cnt would be
    lower-bounded in the end to 2 to have delayed-ACK slow-start behavior.
    
    This particularly shows up when slow_start_after_idle is disabled
    as a dangerous cwnd inflation (1.5 x RTT) after few seconds of idle
    time.
    
    Jana initial fix was to reset epoch_start if app limited,
    but Neal pointed out it would ask the CUBIC algorithm to recalculate the
    curve so that we again start growing steeply upward from where cwnd is
    now (as CUBIC does just after a loss). Ideally we'd want the cwnd growth
    curve to be the same shape, just shifted later in time by the amount of
    the idle period.

    also q->qdisc is used by ->reset and ->destroy so we need it initialized.

    sch_cbq: fix null pointer dereferences on init failure
    
    commit 3501d059921246ff617b43e86250a719c140bd97 upstream.
    
    CBQ can fail on ->init by wrong nl attributes or simply for missing any,
    f.e. if it's set as a default qdisc then TCA_OPTIONS (opt) will be NULL
    when it is activated. The first thing init does is parse opt but it will
    dereference a null pointer if used as a default qdisc, also since init
    failure at default qdisc invokes ->reset() which cancels all timers then
    we'll also dereference two more null pointers (timer->base) as they were
    never initialized.
    
    To reproduce:
    $ sysctl net.core.default_qdisc=cbq
    $ ip l set ethX up
    
    Crash log of the first null ptr deref:

    sch_netem: avoid null pointer deref on init failure
    
    commit 634576a1844dba15bc5e6fc61d72f37e13a21615 upstream.
    
    netem can fail in ->init due to missing options (either not supplied by
    user-space or used as a default qdisc) causing a timer->base null
    pointer deref in its ->destroy() and ->reset() callbacks.
    
    Reproduce:
    $ sysctl net.core.default_qdisc=netem
    $ ip l set ethX up

    sch_fq_codel: avoid double free on init failure
    
    It is very unlikely to happen but the backlogs memory allocation
    could fail and will free q->flows, but then ->destroy() will free
    q->flows too. For correctness remove the first free and let ->destroy
    clean up.

    sch_hfsc: fix null pointer deref and double free on init failure
    
    commit 3bdac362a2f89ed3e148fa6f38c5f5d858f50b1a upstream.
    
    Depending on where ->init fails we can get a null pointer deref due to
    uninitialized hires timer (watchdog) or a double free of the qdisc hash
    because it is already freed by ->destroy().

    sch_multiq: fix double free on init failure
    
    commit e89d469e3be3ed3d7124a803211a463ff83d0964 upstream.
    
    The below commit added a call to ->destroy() on init failure, but multiq
    still frees ->queues on error in init, but ->queues is also freed by
    ->destroy() thus we get double free and corrupted memory.
    
    Very easy to reproduce (eth0 not multiqueue):
    $ tc qdisc add dev eth0 root multiq
    RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
    $ ip l add dumdum type dummy
    (crash)

    sch_htb: fix crash on init failure
    
    commit 88c2ace69dbef696edba77712882af03879abc9c upstream.
    
    The commit below added a call to the ->destroy() callback for all qdiscs
    which failed in their ->init(), but some were not prepared for such
    change and can't handle partially initialized qdisc. HTB is one of them
    and if any error occurs before the qdisc watchdog timer and qdisc work are
    initialized then we can hit either a null ptr deref (timer->base) when
    canceling in ->destroy or lockdep error info about trying to register
    a non-static key and a stack dump. So to fix these two move the watchdog
    timer and workqueue init before anything that can err out.
    To reproduce userspace needs to send broken htb qdisc create request,
    tested with a modified tc (q_htb.c).

    net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation
    
    commit 87b60cfacf9f17cf71933c6e33b66e68160af71d upstream.
    
    Dmitry reported uses after free in qdisc code [1]
    
    The problem here is that ops->init() can return an error.
    
    qdisc_create_dflt() then call ops->destroy(),
    while qdisc_create() does _not_ call it.
    
    Four qdisc chose to call their own ops->destroy(), assuming their caller
    would not.
    
    This patch makes sure qdisc_create() calls ops->destroy()
    and fixes the four qdisc to avoid double free.

    net sched filters: fix notification of filter delete with proper handle
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ee7837449b3d6f0fcf9132c6b5e5aaa58cc67d4 ]
    
    Daniel says:
    
    While trying out [1][2], I noticed that tc monitor doesn't show the
    correct handle on delete:
    
    $ tc monitor
    qdisc clsact ffff: dev eno1 parent ffff:fff1
    filter dev eno1 ingress protocol all pref 49152 bpf handle 0x2a [...]
    deleted filter dev eno1 ingress protocol all pref 49152 bpf handle 0xf3be0c80
    
    some context to explain the above:
    The user identity of any tc filter is represented by a 32-bit
    identifier encoded in tcm->tcm_handle. Example 0x2a in the bpf filter
    above. A user wishing to delete, get or even modify a specific filter
    uses this handle to reference it.
    Every classifier is free to provide its own semantics for the 32 bit handle.
    Example: classifiers like u32 use schemes like 800:1:801 to describe
    the semantics of their filters represented as hash table, bucket and
    node ids etc.
    Classifiers also have internal per-filter representation which is different
    from this externally visible identity. Most classifiers set this
    internal representation to be a pointer address (which allows fast retrieval
    of said filters in their implementations). This internal representation
    is referenced with the "fh" variable in the kernel control code.
    
    When a user successfuly deletes a specific filter, by specifying the correct
    tcm->tcm_handle, an event is generated to user space which indicates
    which specific filter was deleted.
    
    Before this patch, the "fh" value was sent to user space as the identity.
    As an example what is shown in the sample bpf filter delete event above
    is 0xf3be0c80. This is infact a 32-bit truncation of 0xffff8807f3be0c80
    which happens to be a 64-bit memory address of the internal filter
    representation (address of the corresponding filter's struct cls_bpf_prog);
    
    After this patch the appropriate user identifiable handle as encoded
    in the originating request tcm->tcm_handle is generated in the event.
    One of the cardinal rules of netlink rules is to be able to take an
    event (such as a delete in this case) and reflect it back to the
    kernel and successfully delete the filter. This patch achieves that.
    
    Note, this issue has existed since the original TC action
    infrastructure code patch back in 2004 as found in:
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/

    As Jamal pointed out, there is actually no need to call dequeue
    to purge the queued skb's in reset, data structures can be just
    reset explicitly. Therefore, we reset everything except config's
    and stats, so that we would have a fresh start after device flipping.

    ipv6: dad: don't remove dynamic addresses if link is down
    
    commit ec8add2a4c9df723c94a863b8fcd6d93c472deed upstream.
    
    Currently, when the link for $DEV is down, this command succeeds but the
    address is removed immediately by DAD (1):
    
        ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800
    
    In the same situation, this will succeed and not remove the address (2):
    
        ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV
        ip addr change 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800
    
    The comment in addrconf_dad_begin() when !IF_READY makes it look like
    this is the intended behavior, but doesn't explain why:
    
         * If the device is not ready:
         * - keep it tentative if it is a permanent address.
         * - otherwise, kill it.
    
    We clearly cannot prevent userspace from doing (2), but we can make (1)
    work consistently with (2).
    
    addrconf_dad_stop() is only called in two cases: if DAD failed, or to
    skip DAD when the link is down. In that second case, the fix is to avoid
    deleting the address, like we already do for permanent addresses.

    The userspace needs to know why is the address being removed so that it can
    perhaps obtain a new address.
    
    Without the DADFAILED flag it's impossible to distinguish removal of a
    temporary and tentative address due to DAD failure from other reasons (device
    removed, manual address removal).

    tcp: fix tcp_mtu_probe() vs highest_sack
    
    commit 2b7cda9c35d3b940eb9ce74b30bbd5eb30db493d upstream.
    
    Based on SNMP values provided by Roman, Yuchung made the observation
    that some crashes in tcp_sacktag_walk() might be caused by MTU probing.
    
    Looking at tcp_mtu_probe(), I found that when a new skb was placed
    in front of the write queue, we were not updating tcp highest sack.
    
    If one skb is freed because all its content was copied to the new skb
    (for MTU probing), then tp->highest_sack could point to a now freed skb.
    
    Bad things would then happen, including infinite loops.
    
    This patch renames tcp_highest_sack_combine() and uses it
    from tcp_mtu_probe() to fix the bug.
    
    Note that I also removed one test against tp->sacked_out,
    since we want to replace tp->highest_sack regardless of whatever
    condition, since keeping a stale pointer to freed skb is a recipe
    for disaster.

    FS-Cache: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
    
    commit d124b2c53c7bee6569d2a2d0b18b4a1afde00134 upstream.
    
    When the file /proc/fs/fscache/objects (available with
    CONFIG_FSCACHE_OBJECT_LIST=y) is opened, we request a user key with
    description "fscache:objlist", then access its payload.  However, a
    revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for this.
    request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a window
    where the key can be revoked before we access its payload.
    
    Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
    already revoked at the time it was requested.

    commit da7c9561015e93d10fe6aab73e9288e0d09d65a6 upstream.
    
    Packet socket option po->has_vnet_hdr can be updated concurrently with
    other operations if no ring is attached.
    
    Do not test the option twice in packet_snd, as the value may change in
    between calls. A race on setsockopt disable may cause a packet > mtu
    to be sent without having GSO options set.

    qdisc: allow setting default queuing discipline
    
    By default, the pfifo_fast queue discipline has been used by default
    for all devices. But we have better choices now.
    
    This patch allow setting the default queueing discipline with sysctl.
    This allows easy use of better queueing disciplines on all devices
    without having to use tc qdisc scripts. It is intended to allow
    an easy path for distributions to make fq_codel or sfq the default
    qdisc.
    
    This patch also makes pfifo_fast more of a first class qdisc, since
    it is now possible to manually override the default and explicitly
    use pfifo_fast. The behavior for systems who do not use the sysctl
    is unchanged, they still get pfifo_fast
    
    Also removes leftover random # in sysctl net core.

    8021q: fix a memory leak for VLAN 0 device
    
    A vlan device with vid 0 is allow to creat by not able to be fully
    cleaned up by unregister_vlan_dev() which checks for vlan_id!=0.
    
    Also, VLAN 0 is probably not a valid number and it is kinda
    "reserved" for HW accelerating devices, but it is probably too
    late to reject it from creation even if makes sense. Instead,
    just remove the check in unregister_vlan_dev().

    vlan: fix a use-after-free in vlan_device_event()
    
    After refcnt reaches zero, vlan_vid_del() could free
    dev->vlan_info via RCU:
    
            RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->vlan_info, NULL);
            call_rcu(&vlan_info->rcu, vlan_info_rcu_free);
    
    However, the pointer 'grp' still points to that memory
    since it is set before vlan_vid_del():
    
            vlan_info = rtnl_dereference(dev->vlan_info);
            if (!vlan_info)
                    goto out;
            grp = &vlan_info->grp;
    
    Depends on when that RCU callback is scheduled, we could
    trigger a use-after-free in vlan_group_for_each_dev()
    right following this vlan_vid_del().
    
    Fix it by moving vlan_vid_del() before setting grp. This
    is also symmetric to the vlan_vid_add() we call in
    vlan_device_event().

    netfilter: x_tables: fix unconditional helper
    
    commit 54d83fc74aa9ec72794373cb47432c5f7fb1a309 upstream.
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Problem is that mark_source_chains should not have been called --
    the rule doesn't have a next entry, so its supposed to return
    an absolute verdict of either ACCEPT or DROP.
    
    However, the function conditional() doesn't work as the name implies.
    It only checks that the rule is using wildcard address matching.
    
    However, an unconditional rule must also not be using any matches
    (no -m args).
    
    The underflow validator only checked the addresses, therefore
    passing the 'unconditional absolute verdict' test, while
    mark_source_chains also tested for presence of matches, and thus
    proceeeded to the next (not-existent) rule.
    
    Unify this so that all the callers have same idea of 'unconditional rule'.

    crypto: salsa20 - fix blkcipher_walk API usage
    
    commit ecaaab5649781c5a0effdaf298a925063020500e upstream.
    
    When asked to encrypt or decrypt 0 bytes, both the generic and x86
    implementations of Salsa20 crash in blkcipher_walk_done(), either when
    doing 'kfree(walk->buffer)' or 'free_page((unsigned long)walk->page)',
    because walk->buffer and walk->page have not been initialized.
    
    The bug is that Salsa20 is calling blkcipher_walk_done() even when
    nothing is in 'walk.nbytes'.  But blkcipher_walk_done() is only meant to
    be called when a nonzero number of bytes have been provided.
    
    The broken code is part of an optimization that tries to make only one
    call to salsa20_encrypt_bytes() to process inputs that are not evenly
    divisible by 64 bytes.  To fix the bug, just remove this "optimization"
    and use the blkcipher_walk API the same way all the other users do.
    
    Reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main()

    crypto: hmac - require that the underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed
    
    commit af3ff8045bbf3e32f1a448542e73abb4c8ceb6f1 upstream.
    
    Because the HMAC template didn't check that its underlying hash
    algorithm is unkeyed, trying to use "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))"
    through AF_ALG or through KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE resulted in the inner HMAC
    being used without having been keyed, resulting in sha3_update() being
    called without sha3_init(), causing a stack buffer overflow.
    
    This is a very old bug, but it seems to have only started causing real
    problems when SHA-3 support was added (requires CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA3)
    because the innermost hash's state is ->import()ed from a zeroed buffer,
    and it just so happens that other hash algorithms are fine with that,
    but SHA-3 is not.  However, there could be arch or hardware-dependent
    hash algorithms also affected; I couldn't test everything.
    
    Fix the bug by introducing a function crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
    which tests whether a shash algorithm is keyed.  Then update the HMAC
    template to require that its underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed.
    
    Here is a reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            int algfd;
            struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
                .salg_type = "hash",
                .salg_name = "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))",
            };
            char key[4096] = { 0 };
    
            algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
            bind(algfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
            setsockopt(algfd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key, sizeof(key));
        }

    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    commit 1137b5e2529a8f5ca8ee709288ecba3e68044df2 upstream.
    
    This is a fix for CVE-2017-16939 suitable for older stable branches.
    The upstream fix is commit 1137b5e2529a8f5ca8ee709288ecba3e68044df2,
    from which the following explanation is taken:
    
        An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
        this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
        program.
    
        The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
        have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
        triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
        buffer is full.
    
    It was not possible to define a 'start' callback for netlink dumps
    until Linux 4.5, so instead add a check for the initialisation flag in
    the 'done' callback.

    af_key: do not use GFP_KERNEL in atomic contexts
    
    commit 36f41f8fc6d8aa9f8c9072d66ff7cf9055f5e69b upstream.

    xfrm: fix stack access out of bounds with CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY
    
    commit 9b3eb54106cf6acd03f07cf0ab01c13676a226c2 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY=y, xfrm_dst stores a copy of the flowi for
    that dst. Unfortunately, the code that allocates and fills this copy
    doesn't care about what type of flowi (flowi, flowi4, flowi6) gets
    passed. In multiple code paths (from raw_sendmsg, from TCP when
    replying to a FIN, in vxlan, geneve, and gre), the flowi that gets
    passed to xfrm is actually an on-stack flowi4, so we end up reading
    stuff from the stack past the end of the flowi4 struct.
    
    Since xfrm_dst->origin isn't used anywhere following commit
    ca116922afa8 ("xfrm: Eliminate "fl" and "pol" args to
    xfrm_bundle_ok()."), just get rid of it.  xfrm_dst->partner isn't used
    either, so get rid of that too.

    l2tp: don't use l2tp_tunnel_find() in l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6
    
    commit 8f7dc9ae4a7aece9fbc3e6637bdfa38b36bcdf09 upstream.
    
    Using l2tp_tunnel_find() in l2tp_ip_recv() is wrong for two reasons:
    
      * It doesn't take a reference on the returned tunnel, which makes the
        call racy wrt. concurrent tunnel deletion.
    
      * The lookup is only based on the tunnel identifier, so it can return
        a tunnel that doesn't match the packet's addresses or protocol.
    
    For example, a packet sent to an L2TPv3 over IPv6 tunnel can be
    delivered to an L2TPv2 over UDPv4 tunnel. This is worse than a simple
    cross-talk: when delivering the packet to an L2TP over UDP tunnel, the
    corresponding socket is UDP, where ->sk_backlog_rcv() is NULL. Calling
    sk_receive_skb() will then crash the kernel by trying to execute this
    callback.
    
    And l2tp_tunnel_find() isn't even needed here. __l2tp_ip_bind_lookup()
    properly checks the socket binding and connection settings. It was used
    as a fallback mechanism for finding tunnels that didn't have their data
    path registered yet. But it's not limited to this case and can be used
    to replace l2tp_tunnel_find() in the general case.
    
    Fix l2tp_ip6 in the same way.

    commit 94d7ee0baa8b764cf64ad91ed69464c1a6a0066b upstream.
    
    The code following l2tp_tunnel_find() expects that a new reference is
    held on sk. Either sk_receive_skb() or the discard_put error path will
    drop a reference from the tunnel's socket.
    
    This issue exists in both l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6.

    l2tp: check ps->sock before running pppol2tp_session_ioctl()
    
    commit 5903f594935a3841137c86b9d5b75143a5b7121c upstream.
    
    When pppol2tp_session_ioctl() is called by pppol2tp_tunnel_ioctl(),
    the session may be unconnected. That is, it was created by
    pppol2tp_session_create() and hasn't been connected with
    pppol2tp_connect(). In this case, ps->sock is NULL, so we need to check
    for this case in order to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.

    l2tp: fix l2tp_eth module loading
    
    commit 9f775ead5e570e7e19015b9e4e2f3dd6e71a5935 upstream.
    
    The l2tp_eth module crashes if its netlink callbacks are run when the
    pernet data aren't initialised.
    
    We should normally register_pernet_device() before the genl callbacks.
    However, the pernet data only maintain a list of l2tpeth interfaces,
    and this list is never used. So let's just drop pernet handling
    instead.

    l2tp: pass tunnel pointer to ->session_create()
    
    commit f026bc29a8e093edfbb2a77700454b285c97e8ad upstream.
    
    Using l2tp_tunnel_find() in pppol2tp_session_create() and
    l2tp_eth_create() is racy, because no reference is held on the
    returned session. These functions are only used to implement the
    ->session_create callback which is run by l2tp_nl_cmd_session_create().
    Therefore searching for the parent tunnel isn't necessary because
    l2tp_nl_cmd_session_create() already has a pointer to it and holds a
    reference.
    
    This patch modifies ->session_create()'s prototype to directly pass the
    the parent tunnel as parameter, thus avoiding searching for it in
    pppol2tp_session_create() and l2tp_eth_create().
    
    Since we have to touch the ->session_create() call in
    l2tp_nl_cmd_session_create(), let's also remove the useless conditional:
    we know that ->session_create isn't NULL at this point because it's
    already been checked earlier in this same function.
    
    Finally, one might be tempted to think that the removed
    l2tp_tunnel_find() calls were harmless because they would return the
    same tunnel as the one held by l2tp_nl_cmd_session_create() anyway.
    But that tunnel might be removed and a new one created with same tunnel
    Id before the l2tp_tunnel_find() call. In this case l2tp_tunnel_find()
    would return the new tunnel which wouldn't be protected by the
    reference held by l2tp_nl_cmd_session_create().

    l2tp: prevent creation of sessions on terminated tunnels
    
    commit f3c66d4e144a0904ea9b95d23ed9f8eb38c11bfb upstream.
    
    l2tp_tunnel_destruct() sets tunnel->sock to NULL, then removes the
    tunnel from the pernet list and finally closes all its sessions.
    Therefore, it's possible to add a session to a tunnel that is still
    reachable, but for which tunnel->sock has already been reset. This can
    make l2tp_session_create() dereference a NULL pointer when calling
    sock_hold(tunnel->sock).
    
    This patch adds the .acpt_newsess field to struct l2tp_tunnel, which is
    used by l2tp_tunnel_closeall() to prevent addition of new sessions to
    tunnels. Resetting tunnel->sock is done after l2tp_tunnel_closeall()
    returned, so that l2tp_session_add_to_tunnel() can safely take a
    reference on it when .acpt_newsess is true.
    
    The .acpt_newsess field is modified in l2tp_tunnel_closeall(), rather
    than in l2tp_tunnel_destruct(), so that it benefits all tunnel removal
    mechanisms. E.g. on UDP tunnels, a session could be added to a tunnel
    after l2tp_udp_encap_destroy() proceeded. This would prevent the tunnel
    from being removed because of the references held by this new session
    on the tunnel and its socket. Even though the session could be removed
    manually later on, this defeats the purpose of
    commit 9980d001cec8 ("l2tp: add udp encap socket destroy handler").

    l2tp: remove useless duplicate session detection in l2tp_netlink
    
    commit af87ae465abdc070de0dc35d6c6a9e7a8cd82987 upstream.
    
    There's no point in checking for duplicate sessions at the beginning of
    l2tp_nl_cmd_session_create(); the ->session_create() callbacks already
    return -EEXIST when the session already exists.
    
    Furthermore, even if l2tp_session_find() returns NULL, a new session
    might be created right after the test. So relying on ->session_create()
    to avoid duplicate session is the only sane behaviour.

    l2tp: hold tunnel while looking up sessions in l2tp_netlink
    
    commit 54652eb12c1b72e9602d09cb2821d5760939190f upstream.
    
    l2tp_tunnel_find() doesn't take a reference on the returned tunnel.
    Therefore, it's unsafe to use it because the returned tunnel can go
    away on us anytime.
    
    Fix this by defining l2tp_tunnel_get(), which works like
    l2tp_tunnel_find(), but takes a reference on the returned tunnel.
    Caller then has to drop this reference using l2tp_tunnel_dec_refcount().
    
    As l2tp_tunnel_dec_refcount() needs to be moved to l2tp_core.h, let's
    simplify the patch and not move the L2TP_REFCNT_DEBUG part. This code
    has been broken (not even compiling) in May 2012 by
    commit a4ca44fa578c ("net: l2tp: Standardize logging styles")
    and fixed more than two years later by
    commit 29abe2fda54f ("l2tp: fix missing line continuation"). So it
    doesn't appear to be used by anyone.
    
    Same thing for l2tp_tunnel_free(); instead of moving it to l2tp_core.h,
    let's just simplify things and call kfree_rcu() directly in
    l2tp_tunnel_dec_refcount(). Extra assertions and debugging code
    provided by l2tp_tunnel_free() didn't help catching any of the
    reference counting and socket handling issues found while working on
    this series.

    dereferences the associated PPPoL2TP socket and that
    l2tp_dfs_seq_session_show() might call pppol2tp_show(), we also need to

    l2tp: take a reference on sessions used in genetlink handlers
    
    commit 2777e2ab5a9cf2b4524486c6db1517a6ded25261 upstream.
    
    Callers of l2tp_nl_session_find() need to hold a reference on the
    returned session since there's no guarantee that it isn't going to
    disappear from under them.
    
    Relying on the fact that no l2tp netlink message may be processed
    concurrently isn't enough: sessions can be deleted by other means
    (e.g. by closing the PPPOL2TP socket of a ppp pseudowire).
    
    l2tp_nl_cmd_session_delete() is a bit special: it runs a callback
    function that may require a previous call to session->ref(). In
    particular, for ppp pseudowires, the callback is l2tp_session_delete(),
    which then calls pppol2tp_session_close() and dereferences the PPPOL2TP
    socket. The socket might already be gone at the moment
    l2tp_session_delete() calls session->ref(), so we need to take a
    reference during the session lookup. So we need to pass the do_ref
    variable down to l2tp_session_get() and l2tp_session_get_by_ifname().
    
    Since all callers have to be updated, l2tp_session_find_by_ifname() and
    l2tp_nl_session_find() are renamed to reflect their new behaviour.

    l2tp: fix duplicate session creation
    
    commit dbdbc73b44782e22b3b4b6e8b51e7a3d245f3086 upstream.
    
    l2tp_session_create() relies on its caller for checking for duplicate
    sessions. This is racy since a session can be concurrently inserted
    after the caller's verification.
    
    Fix this by letting l2tp_session_create() verify sessions uniqueness
    upon insertion. Callers need to be adapted to check for
    l2tp_session_create()'s return code instead of calling
    l2tp_session_find().
    
    pppol2tp_connect() is a bit special because it has to work on existing
    sessions (if they're not connected) or to create a new session if none
    is found. When acting on a preexisting session, a reference must be
    held or it could go away on us. So we have to use l2tp_session_get()
    instead of l2tp_session_find() and drop the reference before exiting.

    l2tp: ensure session can't get removed during pppol2tp_session_ioctl()
    
    commit 57377d63547861919ee634b845c7caa38de4a452 upstream.
    
    Holding a reference on session is required before calling
    pppol2tp_session_ioctl(). The session could get freed while processing the
    ioctl otherwise. Since pppol2tp_session_ioctl() uses the session's socket,
    we also need to take a reference on it in l2tp_session_get().

    commit 61b9a047729bb230978178bca6729689d0c50ca2 upstream.
    
    Taking a reference on sessions in l2tp_recv_common() is racy; this
    has to be done by the callers.
    
    To this end, a new function is required (l2tp_session_get()) to

    have to manually drop this reference.

    l2tp: do not use udp_ioctl()
    
    commit 72fb96e7bdbbdd4421b0726992496531060f3636 upstream.
    
    udp_ioctl(), as its name suggests, is used by UDP protocols,
    but is also used by L2TP :(
    
    L2TP should use its own handler, because it really does not
    look the same.
    
    SIOCINQ for instance should not assume UDP checksum or headers.
    
    Thanks to Andrey and syzkaller team for providing the report
    and a nice reproducer.
    
    While crashes only happen on recent kernels (after commit
    7c13f97ffde6 ("udp: do fwd memory scheduling on dequeue")), this
    probably needs to be backported to older kernels.

    It has been reported that the dummy byte we add to avoid

    some operators will drop the connection if this happens.
    
    In theory, QMI devices are based on CDC ECM and should as such

    This specifically fixes the descriptor layout whenever VHCI_HC_PORTS is

    USB: core: prevent malicious bNumInterfaces overflow
    
    commit 48a4ff1c7bb5a32d2e396b03132d20d552c0eca7 upstream.
    
    A malicious USB device with crafted descriptors can cause the kernel
    to access unallocated memory by setting the bNumInterfaces value too
    high in a configuration descriptor.  Although the value is adjusted
    during parsing, this adjustment is skipped in one of the error return
    paths.
    
    This patch prevents the problem by setting bNumInterfaces to 0
    initially.  The existing code already sets it to the proper value
    after parsing is complete.

    commit ed62ca2f4f51c17841ea39d98c0c409cb53a3e10 upstream.
    
    While running reboot tests w/ a specific set of USB devices (and

    Investigation using kgdb() found that the wait queue that was passed
    into wake_up() had been freed (it was filled with slub_debug poison).
    
    I analyzed and instrumented the code and reproduced.  My current
    belief is that this is happening:
    
    1. async_completed() is called (from IRQ).  Moves "as" onto the
       completed list.
    2. On another CPU, proc_reapurbnonblock_compat() calls
       async_getcompleted().  Blocks on spinlock.
    3. async_completed() releases the lock; keeps running; gets blocked
       midway through wake_up().
    4. proc_reapurbnonblock_compat() => async_getcompleted() gets the
       lock; removes "as" from completed list and frees it.
    5. usbdev_release() is called.  Frees "ps".
    6. async_completed() finally continues running wake_up().  ...but
       wake_up() has a pointer to the freed "ps".
    
    The instrumentation that led me to believe this was based on adding
    some trace_printk() calls in a select few functions and then using
    kdb's "ftdump" at crash time.  The trace follows (NOTE: in the trace
    below I cheated a little bit and added a udelay(1000) in
    async_completed() after releasing the spinlock because I wanted it to
    trigger quicker):
    
    <...>-2104   0d.h2 13759034us!: async_completed at start: as=ffffffc0cc638200
    mtpd-2055    3.... 13759356us : async_getcompleted before spin_lock_irqsave
    mtpd-2055    3d..1 13759362us : async_getcompleted after list_del_init: as=ffffffc0cc638200
    mtpd-2055    3.... 13759371us+: proc_reapurbnonblock_compat: free_async(ffffffc0cc638200)
    mtpd-2055    3.... 13759422us+: async_getcompleted before spin_lock_irqsave
    mtpd-2055    3.... 13759479us : usbdev_release at start: ps=ffffffc0cc042080
    mtpd-2055    3.... 13759487us : async_getcompleted before spin_lock_irqsave
    mtpd-2055    3.... 13759497us!: usbdev_release after kfree(ps): ps=ffffffc0cc042080
    <...>-2104   0d.h2 13760294us : async_completed before wake_up(): as=ffffffc0cc638200
    
    To fix this problem we can just move the wake_up() under the ps->lock.
    There should be no issues there that I'm aware of.

    USB: core: fix out-of-bounds access bug in usb_get_bos_descriptor()
    
    commit 1c0edc3633b56000e18d82fc241e3995ca18a69e upstream.
    
    Andrey used the syzkaller fuzzer to find an out-of-bounds memory
    access in usb_get_bos_descriptor().  The code wasn't checking that the
    next usb_dev_cap_header structure could fit into the remaining buffer
    space.
    
    This patch fixes the error and also reduces the bNumDeviceCaps field
    in the header to match the actual number of capabilities found, in
    cases where there are fewer than expected.

    USB: fix out-of-bounds in usb_set_configuration
    
    commit bd7a3fe770ebd8391d1c7d072ff88e9e76d063eb upstream.
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for a USB interface
    association descriptor.  He writes:
            It seems there's no proper size check of a USB_DT_INTERFACE_ASSOCIATION
            descriptor. It's only checked that the size is >= 2 in
            usb_parse_configuration(), so find_iad() might do out-of-bounds access
            to intf_assoc->bInterfaceCount.
    
    And he's right, we don't check for crazy descriptors of this type very well, so
    resolve this problem.  Yet another issue found by syzkaller...

    USB: serial: option: add support for D-Link DWM-157 C1
    
    This commit adds support (an ID, really) for D-Link DWM-157 hardware
    version C1 USB modem to option driver.
    
    According to manufacturer-provided Windows INF file the device has four
    serial ports:
    "D-Link HSPA+DataCard Diagnostics Interface" (interface 2; modem port),
    "D-Link HSPA+DataCard NMEA Device" (interface 3),
    "D-Link HSPA+DataCard Speech Port" (interface 4),
    "D-Link HSPA+DataCard Debug Port" (interface 5).

    net: cdc_ncm: GetNtbFormat endian fix
    
    The GetNtbFormat and SetNtbFormat requests operate on 16 bit little
    endian values. We get away with ignoring this most of the time, because
    we only care about USB_CDC_NCM_NTB16_FORMAT which is 0x0000.  This
    fails for USB_CDC_NCM_NTB32_FORMAT.
    
    Fix comparison between LE value from device and constant by converting
    the constant to LE.

    qmi_wwan: Add missing skb_reset_mac_header-call
    
    When we receive a packet on a QMI device in raw IP mode, we should call
    skb_reset_mac_header() to ensure that skb->mac_header contains a valid
    offset in the packet. While it shouldn't really matter, the packets have
    no MAC header and the interface is configured as-such, it seems certain
    parts of the network stack expects a "good" value in skb->mac_header.
    
    Without the skb_reset_mac_header() call added in this patch, for example
    shaping traffic (using tc) triggers the following oops on the first
    received packet:

    cdc_ncm: Set NTB format again after altsetting switch for Huawei devices
    
    Some firmwares in Huawei E3372H devices have been observed to switch back
    to NTB 32-bit format after altsetting switch.
    This patch implements a driver flag to check for the device settings and
    set NTB format to 16-bit again if needed.
    The flag has been activated for devices controlled by the huawei_cdc_ncm.c
    driver.
    
    V1->V2:
    - fixed broken error checks

    cdc_ncm: flag the u-blox TOBY-L4 as wwan
    
    The u-blox TOBY-L4 is a LTE Advanced (Cat 6) module with HSPA+ and 2G
    fallback.
    
    Unlike the TOBY-L2, this module has one single USB layout and exposes
    several TTYs for control and a NCM interface for data. Connecting this
    module may be done just by activating the desired PDP context with
    'AT+CGACT=1,<cid>' and then running DHCP on the NCM interface.

    net: cdc_ncm: Reduce memory use when kernel memory low
    
    The CDC-NCM driver can require large amounts of memory to create
    skb's and this can be a problem when the memory becomes fragmented.
    
    This especially affects embedded systems that have constrained
    resources but wish to maximise the throughput of CDC-NCM with 16KiB
    NTB's.
    
    The issue is after running for a while the kernel memory can become
    fragmented and it needs compacting.
    If the NTB allocation is needed before the memory has been compacted
    the atomic allocation can fail which can cause increased latency,
    large re-transmissions or disconnections depending upon the data
    being transmitted at the time.
    This situation occurs for less than a second until the kernel has
    compacted the memory but the failed devices can take a lot longer to
    recover from the failed TX packets.
    
    To ease this temporary situation I modified the CDC-NCM TX path to
    temporarily switch into a reduced memory mode which allocates an NTB
    that will fit into a USB_CDC_NCM_NTB_MIN_OUT_SIZE (default 2048 Bytes)
    sized memory block and only transmit NTB's with a single network frame
    until the memory situation is resolved.
    Each time this issue occurs we wait for an increasing number of
    reduced size allocations before requesting a full size one to not
    put additional pressure on a low memory system.
    
    Once the memory is compacted the CDC-NCM data can resume transmitting
    at the normal tx_max rate once again.

    ext4: fix fdatasync(2) after extent manipulation operations
    
    commit 67a7d5f561f469ad2fa5154d2888258ab8e6df7c upstream.
    
    Currently, extent manipulation operations such as hole punch, range
    zeroing, or extent shifting do not record the fact that file data has
    changed and thus fdatasync(2) has a work to do. As a result if we crash
    e.g. after a punch hole and fdatasync, user can still possibly see the
    punched out data after journal replay. Test generic/392 fails due to
    these problems.
    
    Fix the problem by properly marking that file data has changed in these
    operations.

    ext4: fix data corruption for mmap writes
    
    commit a056bdaae7a181f7dcc876cfab2f94538e508709 upstream.
    
    mpage_submit_page() can race with another process growing i_size and
    writing data via mmap to the written-back page. As mpage_submit_page()
    samples i_size too early, it may happen that ext4_bio_write_page()
    zeroes out too large tail of the page and thus corrupts user data.
    
    Fix the problem by sampling i_size only after the page has been
    write-protected in page tables by clear_page_dirty_for_io() call.

    ext4: use private version of page_zero_new_buffers() for data=journal mode
    
    commit b90197b655185a11640cce3a0a0bc5d8291b8ad2 upstream.
    
    If there is a error while copying data from userspace into the page
    cache during a write(2) system call, in data=journal mode, in
    ext4_journalled_write_end() were using page_zero_new_buffers() from
    fs/buffer.c.  Unfortunately, this sets the buffer dirty flag, which is
    no good if journalling is enabled.  This is a long-standing bug that
    goes back for years and years in ext3, but a combination of (a)
    data=journal not being very common, (b) in many case it only results
    in a warning message. and (c) only very rarely causes the kernel hang,
    means that we only really noticed this as a problem when commit
    998ef75ddb caused this failure to happen frequently enough to cause
    generic/208 to fail when run in data=journal mode.
    
    The fix is to have our own version of this function that doesn't call
    mark_dirty_buffer(), since we will end up calling
    ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() on the buffer head(s) in questions very
    shortly afterwards in ext4_journalled_write_end().
    
    Thanks to Dave Hansen and Linus Torvalds for helping to identify the
    root cause of the problem.

    ext4: fix reference counting bug on block allocation error
    
    commit 554a5ccc4e4a20c5f3ec859de0842db4b4b9c77e upstream.
    
    If we hit this error when mounted with errors=continue or
    errors=remount-ro:
    
        EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_mb_mark_diskspace_used:2940: comm ext4.exe: Allocating blocks 5090-6081 which overlap fs metadata
    
    then ext4_mb_new_blocks() will call ext4_mb_release_context() and try to
    continue. However, ext4_mb_release_context() is the wrong thing to call
    here since we are still actually using the allocation context.
    
    Instead, just error out. We could retry the allocation, but there is a
    possibility of getting stuck in an infinite loop instead, so this seems

    ext4: validate s_reserved_gdt_blocks on mount
    
    commit 5b9554dc5bf008ae7f68a52e3d7e76c0920938a2 upstream.
    
    If s_reserved_gdt_blocks is extremely large, it's possible for
    ext4_init_block_bitmap(), which is called when ext4 sets up an
    uninitialized block bitmap, to corrupt random kernel memory.  Add the
    same checks which e2fsck has --- it must never be larger than
    blocksize / sizeof(__u32) --- and then add a backup check in
    ext4_init_block_bitmap() in case the superblock gets modified after
    the file system is mounted.

    ext4: fix in-superblock mount options processing
    
    commit 5aee0f8a3f42c94c5012f1673420aee96315925a upstream.
    
    Fix a large number of problems with how we handle mount options in the
    superblock.  For one, if the string in the superblock is long enough
    that it is not null terminated, we could run off the end of the string
    and try to interpret superblocks fields as characters.  It's unlikely
    this will cause a security problem, but it could result in an invalid
    parse.  Also, parse_options is destructive to the string, so in some
    cases if there is a comma-separated string, it would be modified in
    the superblock.  (Fortunately it only happens on file systems with a
    1k block size.)

    ext4: validate s_first_meta_bg at mount time
    
    commit 3a4b77cd47bb837b8557595ec7425f281f2ca1fe upstream.
    
    Ralf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
    modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
    calculating fs overhead (ext4_calculate_overhead()), this is because
    the image has very large s_first_meta_bg (debug code shows it's
    842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count_overhead() when
    setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE_SIZE.
    
    ext4_calculate_overhead():
      buf = get_zeroed_page(GFP_NOFS);  <=== PAGE_SIZE buffer
      blks = count_overhead(sb, i, buf);
    
    count_overhead():
      for (j = ext4_bg_num_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
              ext4_set_bit(EXT4_B2C(sbi, s++), buf);   <=== buffer overrun
              count++;
      }
    
    This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:
    
      #!/bin/bash
      rm -f fs.img
      mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
      fallocate -l 16M fs.img
      mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta_bg,^resize_inode -F fs.img
      debugfs -w -R "ssv first_meta_bg 842150400" fs.img
      mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4
    
    Fix it by validating s_first_meta_bg first at mount time, and
    refusing to mount if its value exceeds the largest possible meta_bg
    number.

    futex: Fix potential use-after-free in FUTEX_REQUEUE_PI
    
    commit c236c8e95a3d395b0494e7108f0d41cf36ec107c upstream.
    
    While working on the futex code, I stumbled over this potential
    use-after-free scenario. Dmitry triggered it later with syzkaller.
    
    pi_mutex is a pointer into pi_state, which we drop the reference on in
    unqueue_me_pi(). So any access to that pointer after that is bad.
    
    Since other sites already do rt_mutex_unlock() with hb->lock held, see
    for example futex_lock_pi(), simply move the unlock before
    unqueue_me_pi().

    MIPS: Fix mips_atomic_set() retry condition
    
    The inline asm retry check in the MIPS_ATOMIC_SET operation of the

    Rewrite sysmips(MIPS_ATOMIC_SET, ...) in C with inline assembler")
    merged in v2.6.32, resulting in the non R10000_LLSC_WAR case retrying
    until the operation was inatomic, before returning the new value that
    was probably just written multiple times instead of the old value.
    
    Invert the branch condition to fix that particular issue.

    ipv6: Fix leak in ipv6_gso_segment().
    
    commit e3e86b5119f81e5e2499bea7ea1ebe8ac6aab789 upstream.
    
    If ip6_find_1stfragopt() fails and we return an error we have to free
    up 'segs' because nobody else is going to.

    ipv6: avoid overflow of offset in ip6_find_1stfragopt
    
    commit 6399f1fae4ec29fab5ec76070435555e256ca3a6 upstream.
    
    In some cases, offset can overflow and can cause an infinite loop in
    ip6_find_1stfragopt(). Make it unsigned int to prevent the overflow, and
    cap it at IPV6_MAXPLEN, since packets larger than that should be invalid.
    
    This problem has been here since before the beginning of git history.

    ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options
    
    commit 2423496af35d94a87156b063ea5cedffc10a70a1 upstream.
    
    The KASAN warning repoted below was discovered with a syzkaller
    program.  The reproducer is basically:
      int s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, NEXTHDR_HOP);
      send(s, &one_byte_of_data, 1, MSG_MORE);
      send(s, &more_than_mtu_bytes_data, 2000, 0);
    
    The socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to
    NEXTHDR_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero
    byte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.
    
    The fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order
    to figure out where to insert the fragment option.  Since nexthdr points
    to an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header
    can made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data
    is read outside of it.
    
    This fix makes ip6_find_1stfrag return an error if it detects
    running out-of-bounds.

    Revert "tcp: Apply device TSO segment limit earlier"
    
    This reverts commit 9f871e883277cc22c6217db806376dce52401a31, which
    was commit 1485348d2424e1131ea42efc033cbd9366462b01 upstream.
    
    It can cause connections to stall when a PMTU event occurs:
    Thomas Jarosch reported IPsec TCP stalls when a PMTU event occurs.
    
    In fact the problem was completely unrelated to IPsec. The bug is
    also reproducible if you just disable TSO/GSO.
    
    The problem is that when the MSS goes down, existing queued packet
    on the TX queue that have not been transmitted yet all look like
    TSO packets and get treated as such.
    
    This was fixed by commit 843925f33fcc ("tcp: Do not apply TSO segment limit to
    non-TSO packets") upstream, but that depends on other changes to TSO.
    
    The original issue this fixed was a performance regression for the sfc
    driver in extreme cases of TSO (skb with > 100 segments).  This is not
    really very important and it seems best to revert it rather than try
    to fix it up.

    bpf: Remove duplicate tcp_filter hook in ipv6
    
    There are two tcp_filter hooks in tcp_ipv6 ingress path currently.
    One is at tcp_v6_rcv and another is in tcp_v6_do_rcv. It seems the
    tcp_filter() call inside tcp_v6_do_rcv is redundent and some packet
    will be filtered twice in this situation. This will cause trouble
    when using eBPF filters to account traffic data.

    tcp: take care of truncations done by sk_filter()
    
    commit ac6e780070e30e4c35bd395acfe9191e6268bdd3 upstream.
    
    With syzkaller help, Marco Grassi found a bug in TCP stack,
    crashing in tcp_collapse()
    
    Root cause is that sk_filter() can truncate the incoming skb,
    but TCP stack was not really expecting this to happen.
    It probably was expecting a simple DROP or ACCEPT behavior.
    
    We first need to make sure no part of TCP header could be removed.
    Then we need to adjust TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->end_seq
    
    Many thanks to syzkaller team and Marco for giving us a reproducer.

    tcp: consider recv buf for the initial window scale
    
    commit f626300a3e776ccc9671b0dd94698fb3aa315966 upstream.
    
    tcp_select_initial_window() intends to advertise a window
    scaling for the maximum possible window size. To do so,
    it considers the maximum of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2] and
    net.core.rmem_max as the only possible upper-bounds.
    However, users with CAP_NET_ADMIN can use SO_RCVBUFFORCE
    to set the socket's receive buffer size to values
    larger than net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2] and net.core.rmem_max.
    Thus, SO_RCVBUFFORCE is effectively ignored by
    tcp_select_initial_window().
    
    To fix this, consider the maximum of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2],
    net.core.rmem_max and socket's initial buffer space.

    tcp_yeah: don't set ssthresh below 2
    
    [ Upstream commit 83d15e70c4d8909d722c0d64747d8fb42e38a48f ]
    
    For tcp_yeah, use an ssthresh floor of 2, the same floor used by Reno
    and CUBIC, per RFC 5681 (equation 4).
    
    tcp_yeah_ssthresh() was sometimes returning a 0 or negative ssthresh
    value if the intended reduction is as big or bigger than the current
    cwnd. Congestion control modules should never return a zero or
    negative ssthresh. A zero ssthresh generally results in a zero cwnd,
    causing the connection to stall. A negative ssthresh value will be
    interpreted as a u32 and will set a target cwnd for PRR near 4
    billion.
    
    Oleksandr Natalenko reported that a system using tcp_yeah with ECN
    could see a warning about a prior_cwnd of 0 in
    tcp_cwnd_reduction(). Testing verified that this was due to
    tcp_yeah_ssthresh() misbehaving in this way.

    netfilter: nf_nat_snmp: Fix panic when snmp_trap_helper fails to register
    
    commit 75c689dca98851d65ef5a27e5ce26b625b68751c upstream.
    
    In the commit 93557f53e1fb ("netfilter: nf_conntrack: nf_conntrack snmp
    helper"), the snmp_helper is replaced by nf_nat_snmp_hook. So the
    snmp_helper is never registered. But it still tries to unregister the
    snmp_helper, it could cause the panic.
    
    Now remove the useless snmp_helper and the unregister call in the
    error handler.

    net: unix: properly re-increment inflight counter of GC discarded candidates
    
    commit 7df9c24625b9981779afb8fcdbe2bb4765e61147 upstream.
    
    Dmitry has reported that a BUG_ON() condition in unix_notinflight()
    may be triggered by a simple code that forwards unix socket in an
    SCM_RIGHTS message.
    That is caused by incorrect unix socket GC implementation in unix_gc().
    
    The GC first collects list of candidates, then (a) decrements their
    "children's" inflight counter, (b) checks which inflight counters are
    now 0, and then (c) increments all inflight counters back.
    (a) and (c) are done by calling scan_children() with inc_inflight or
    dec_inflight as the second argument.
    
    Commit 6209344f5a37 ("net: unix: fix inflight counting bug in garbage
    collector") changed scan_children() such that it no longer considers
    sockets that do not have UNIX_GC_CANDIDATE flag. It also added a block
    of code that that unsets this flag _before_ invoking
    scan_children(, dec_iflight, ). This may lead to incorrect inflight
    counters for some sockets.
    
    This change fixes this bug by changing order of operations:
    UNIX_GC_CANDIDATE is now unset only after all inflight counters are
    restored to the original state.

    unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user_struct
    
    commit 415e3d3e90ce9e18727e8843ae343eda5a58fad6 upstream.
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
    of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
    of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
    deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
    open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
    be credited.
    
    To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
    scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    commit 712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593 upstream.
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.

    fs/seq_file: fix out-of-bounds read
    
    seq_read() is a nasty piece of work, not to mention buggy.

        Disabling lock debugging due to kernel taint
    
    This seems to be the same thing that Dave Jones was seeing here:
    
      https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/12/334
    
    There are multiple issues here:
    
      1) If we enter the function with a non-empty buffer, there is an attempt
         to flush it. But it was not clearing m->from after doing so, which
         means that if we try to do this flush twice in a row without any call
         to traverse() in between, we are going to be reading from the wrong
         place -- the splat above, fixed by this patch.
    
      2) If there's a short write to userspace because of page faults, the
         buffer may already contain multiple lines (i.e. pos has advanced by
         more than 1), but we don't save the progress that was made so the
         next call will output what we've already returned previously. Since
         that is a much less serious issue (and I have a headache after
         staring at seq_read() for the past 8 hours), I'll leave that for now.

    ipmr, ip6mr: fix scheduling while atomic and a deadlock with ipmr_get_route
    
    commit 2cf750704bb6d7ed8c7d732e071dd1bc890ea5e8 upstream.
    
    Since the commit below the ipmr/ip6mr rtnl_unicast() code uses the portid
    instead of the previous dst_pid which was copied from in_skb's portid.
    Since the skb is new the portid is 0 at that point so the packets are sent
    to the kernel and we get scheduling while atomic or a deadlock (depending
    on where it happens) by trying to acquire rtnl two times.
    Also since this is RTM_GETROUTE, it can be triggered by a normal user.
    
    Here's the sleeping while atomic trace:

    MIPS: Fix IRQ tracing & lockdep when rescheduling
    
    When the scheduler sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED & we call into the scheduler
    from arch/mips/kernel/entry.S we disable interrupts. This is true
    regardless of whether we reach work_resched from syscall_exit_work,
    resume_userspace or by looping after calling schedule(). Although we
    disable interrupts in these paths we don't call trace_hardirqs_off()
    before calling into C code which may acquire locks, and we therefore
    leave lockdep with an inconsistent view of whether interrupts are
    disabled or not when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING & CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP are
    both enabled.
    
    Without tracing this interrupt state lockdep will print warnings such
    as the following once a task returns from a syscall via
    syscall_exit_partial with TIF_NEED_RESCHED set:

    Fix this by using the TRACE_IRQS_OFF macro to call trace_hardirqs_off()
    when CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS is enabled. This is done before invoking
    schedule() following the work_resched label because:
    
     1) Interrupts are disabled regardless of the path we take to reach
        work_resched() & schedule().
    
     2) Performing the tracing here avoids the need to do it in paths which
        disable interrupts but don't call out to C code before hitting a
        path which uses the RESTORE_SOME macro that will call
        trace_hardirqs_on() or trace_hardirqs_off() as appropriate.
    
    We call trace_hardirqs_on() using the TRACE_IRQS_ON macro before calling
    syscall_trace_leave() for similar reasons, ensuring that lockdep has a
    consistent view of state after we re-enable interrupts.

    MIPS: mm: fixed mappings: correct initialisation
    
    fixrange_init operates at PMD-granularity and expects the addresses to
    be PMD-size aligned, but currently that might not be the case for
    PKMAP_BASE unless it is defined properly, so ensure a correct alignment
    is used before passing the address to fixrange_init.
    
    fixed mappings: only align the start address that is passed to
    fixrange_init rather than the value before adding the size, as we may
    end up with uninitialised upper part of the range.

    MIPS: KGDB: Use kernel context for sleeping threads
    
    KGDB is a kernel debug stub and it can't be used to debug userland as it
    can only safely access kernel memory.
    
    On MIPS however KGDB has always got the register state of sleeping
    processes from the userland register context at the beginning of the
    kernel stack. This is meaningless for kernel threads (which never enter
    userland), and for user threads it prevents the user seeing what it is
    doing while in the kernel:
    
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id         Frame
      ...
      3    Thread 2 (kthreadd) 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()

      1    Thread -2 (shadowCPU0) 0xffffffff8012524c in arch_kgdb_breakpoint () at arch/mips/kernel/kgdb.c:201
    
    Get the register state instead from the (partial) kernel register
    context stored in the task's thread_struct for resume() to restore. All
    threads now correctly appear to be in context_switch():
    
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id         Frame

    Call clobbered registers which aren't saved and exception registers
    (BadVAddr & Cause) which can't be easily determined without stack
    unwinding are reported as 0. The PC is taken from the return address,
    such that the state presented matches that found immediately after
    returning from resume().

    tcp: eliminate negative reordering in tcp_clean_rtx_queue
    
    tcp_ack() can call tcp_fragment() which may dededuct the
    value tp->fackets_out when MSS changes. When prior_fackets
    is larger than tp->fackets_out, tcp_clean_rtx_queue() can
    invoke tcp_update_reordering() with negative values. This
    results in absurd tp->reodering values higher than
    sysctl_tcp_max_reordering.
    
    Note that tcp_update_reordering indeeds sets tp->reordering
    to min(sysctl_tcp_max_reordering, metric), but because
    the comparison is signed, a negative metric always wins.

    tcp: avoid fragmenting peculiar skbs in SACK
    
    This patch fixes a bug in splitting an SKB during SACK
    processing. Specifically if an skb contains multiple
    packets and is only partially sacked in the higher sequences,
    tcp_match_sack_to_skb() splits the skb and marks the second fragment
    as SACKed.
    
    The current code further attempts rounding up the first fragment
    to MSS boundaries. But it misses a boundary condition when the
    rounded-up fragment size (pkt_len) is exactly skb size.  Spliting
    such an skb is pointless and causses a kernel warning and aborts
    the SACK processing. This patch universally checks such over-split
    before calling tcp_fragment to prevent these unnecessary warnings.

    tcp: initialize rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0
    
    When tcp_disconnect() is called, inet_csk_delack_init() sets
    icsk->icsk_ack.rcv_mss to 0.
    This could potentially cause tcp_recvmsg() => tcp_cleanup_rbuf() =>
    __tcp_select_window() call path to have division by 0 issue.
    So this patch initializes rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0.

    netfilter: ctnetlink: fix incorrect nf_ct_put during hash resize
    
    commit fefa92679dbe0c613e62b6c27235dcfbe9640ad1 upstream.
    
    If nf_conntrack_htable_size was adjusted by the user during the ct
    dump operation, we may invoke nf_ct_put twice for the same ct, i.e.
    the "last" ct. This will cause the ct will be freed but still linked
    in hash buckets.
    
    It's very easy to reproduce the problem by the following commands:
      # while : ; do
      echo $RANDOM > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_buckets
      done
      # while : ; do
      conntrack -L
      done
      # iperf -s 127.0.0.1 &
      # iperf -c 127.0.0.1 -P 60 -t 36000
    
    After a while, the system will hang like this:
      NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 22s! [bash:20184]
      NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [iperf:20382]
      ...
    
    So at last if we find cb->args[1] is equal to "last", this means hash
    resize happened, then we can set cb->args[1] to 0 to fix the above
    issue.

    ip6_tunnel: Fix missing tunnel encapsulation limit option
    
    The IPv6 tunneling code tries to insert IPV6_TLV_TNL_ENCAP_LIMIT and
    IPV6_TLV_PADN options when an encapsulation limit is defined (the
    default is a limit of 4).  An MTU adjustment is done to account for
    these options as well.  However, the options are never present in the
    generated packets.
    
    The issue appears to be a subtlety between IPV6_DSTOPTS and
    IPV6_RTHDRDSTOPTS defined in RFC 3542.  When the IPIP tunnel driver was
    written, the encap limit options were included as IPV6_RTHDRDSTOPTS in
    dst0opt of struct ipv6_txoptions.  Later, ipv6_push_nfrags_opts was
    (correctly) updated to require IPV6_RTHDR options when IPV6_RTHDRDSTOPTS
    are to be used.  This caused the options to no longer be included in v6
    encapsulated packets.
    
    The fix is to use IPV6_DSTOPTS (in dst1opt of struct ipv6_txoptions)
    instead.  IPV6_DSTOPTS do not have the additional IPV6_RTHDR requirement.

    l->owner=T1

                                     unlock(l->wait_lock)

                    fixup_rt_mutex_waiters()

                        owner = l->owner & ~HAS_WAITERS;
                        l->owner = owner
                         ==> l->owner = T1
                      }
    
                                    lock(l->wait_lock)
    rt_mutex_unlock(l)              fixup_rt_mutex_waiters()
                                      if (wait_list_empty(l)) {
                                        owner = l->owner & ~HAS_WAITERS;
    cmpxchg(l->owner, T1, NULL)
     ===> Success (l->owner = NULL)
                                        l->owner = owner
                                         ==> l->owner = T1
                                      }
    
    That means the problem is caused by fixup_rt_mutex_waiters() which does the
    RMW to clear the waiters bit unconditionally when there are no waiters in
    the rtmutexes rbtree.
    
    This can be fatal: A concurrent unlock can release the rtmutex in the
    fastpath because the waiters bit is not set. If the cmpxchg() gets in the
    middle of the RMW operation then the previous owner, which just unlocked
    the rtmutex is set as the owner again when the write takes place after the
    successfull cmpxchg().
    
    The solution is rather trivial: verify that the owner member of the rtmutex
    has the waiters bit set before clearing it. This does not require a
    cmpxchg() or other atomic operations because the waiters bit can only be
    set and cleared with the rtmutex wait_lock held. It's also safe against the
    fast path unlock attempt. The unlock attempt via cmpxchg() will either see
    the bit set and take the slowpath or see the bit cleared and release it
    atomically in the fastpath.
    
    It's remarkable that the test program provided by David triggers on ARM64
    and MIPS64 really quick, but it refuses to reproduce on x86-64, while the
    problem exists there as well. That refusal might explain that this got not
    discovered earlier despite the bug existing from day one of the rtmutex
    implementation more than 10 years ago.
    
    Thanks to David for meticulously instrumenting the code and providing the
    information which allowed to decode this subtle problem.

    xfrm_user: validate XFRM_MSG_NEWAE XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL replay_window
    
    When a new xfrm state is created during an XFRM_MSG_NEWSA call we
    validate the user supplied replay_esn to ensure that the size is valid
    and to ensure that the replay_window size is within the allocated
    buffer.  However later it is possible to update this replay_esn via a
    XFRM_MSG_NEWAE call.  There we again validate the size of the supplied
    buffer matches the existing state and if so inject the contents.  We do
    not at this point check that the replay_window is within the allocated
    memory.  This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes triggered by
    netlink packets.  This leads to memory corruption and the potential for
    priviledge escalation.
    
    We already attempt to validate the incoming replay information in
    xfrm_new_ae() via xfrm_replay_verify_len().  This confirms that the user
    is not trying to change the size of the replay state buffer which
    includes the replay_esn.  It however does not check the replay_window
    remains within that buffer.  Add validation of the contained
    replay_window.

    xfrm: Fix memory leak of aead algorithm name
    
    commit 1a6509d99122 ("[IPSEC]: Add support for combined mode algorithms")
    introduced aead. The function attach_aead kmemdup()s the algorithm
    name during xfrm_state_construct().
    However this memory is never freed.
    Implementation has since been slightly modified in
    commit ee5c23176fcc ("xfrm: Clone states properly on migration")
    without resolving this leak.
    This patch adds a kfree() call for the aead algorithm name.

    udp: avoid ufo handling on IP payload compression packets
    
    commit c146066ab802 ("ipv4: Don't use ufo handling on later transformed
    packets") and commit f89c56ce710a ("ipv6: Don't use ufo handling on
    later transformed packets") added a check that 'rt->dst.header_len' isn't
    zero in order to skip UFO, but it doesn't include IPcomp in transport mode
    where it equals zero.
    
    Packets, after payload compression, may not require further fragmentation,
    and if original length exceeds MTU, later compressed packets will be
    transmitted incorrectly. This can be reproduced with LTP udp_ipsec.sh test
    on veth device with enabled UFO, MTU is 1500 and UDP payload is 2000:
    
    * IPv4 case, offset is wrong + unnecessary fragmentation
        udp_ipsec.sh -p comp -m transport -s 2000 &
        tcpdump -ni ltp_ns_veth2
        ...
        IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 45203, offset 0, flags [+],
          proto Compressed IP (108), length 49)
          10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: IPComp(cpi=0x1000)
        IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 45203, offset 1480, flags [none],
          proto UDP (17), length 21) 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ip-proto-17
    
    * IPv6 case, sending small fragments
        udp_ipsec.sh -6 -p comp -m transport -s 2000 &
        tcpdump -ni ltp_ns_veth2
        ...
        IP6 (flowlabel 0x6b9ba, hlim 64, next-header Compressed IP (108)
          payload length: 37) fd00::2 > fd00::1: IPComp(cpi=0x1000)
        IP6 (flowlabel 0x6b9ba, hlim 64, next-header Compressed IP (108)
          payload length: 21) fd00::2 > fd00::1: IPComp(cpi=0x1000)
    
    Fix it by checking 'rt->dst.xfrm' pointer to 'xfrm_state' struct, skip UFO
    if xfrm is set. So the new check will include both cases: IPcomp and IPsec.

    KEYS: fix dereferencing NULL payload with nonzero length
    
    sys_add_key() and the KEYCTL_UPDATE operation of sys_keyctl() allowed a
    NULL payload with nonzero length to be passed to the key type's
    ->preparse(), ->instantiate(), and/or ->update() methods.  Various key
    types including asymmetric, cifs.idmap, cifs.spnego, and pkcs7_test did
    not handle this case, allowing an unprivileged user to trivially cause a
    NULL pointer dereference (kernel oops) if one of these key types was
    present.  Fix it by doing the copy_from_user() when 'plen' is nonzero
    rather than when '_payload' is non-NULL, causing the syscall to fail
    with EFAULT as expected when an invalid buffer is specified.

    The default error code in pfkey_msg2xfrm_state() is -ENOBUFS.  We
    added a new call to security_xfrm_state_alloc() which sets "err" to zero
    so there several places where we can return ERR_PTR(0) if kmalloc()
    fails.  The caller is expecting error pointers so it leads to a NULL
    dereference.

    tty: Prevent ldisc drivers from re-using stale tty fields
    
    Line discipline drivers may mistakenly misuse ldisc-related fields
    when initializing. For example, a failure to initialize tty->receive_room
    in the N_GIGASET_M101 line discipline was recently found and fixed [1].
    Now, the N_X25 line discipline has been discovered accessing the previous
    line discipline's already-freed private data [2].
    
    Harden the ldisc interface against misuse by initializing revelant
    tty fields before instancing the new line discipline.

    tty: Fix unsafe ldisc reference via ioctl(TIOCGETD)
    
    ioctl(TIOCGETD) retrieves the line discipline id directly from the
    ldisc because the line discipline id (c_line) in termios is untrustworthy;
    userspace may have set termios via ioctl(TCSETS*) without actually
    changing the line discipline via ioctl(TIOCSETD).
    
    However, directly accessing the current ldisc via tty->ldisc is
    unsafe; the ldisc ptr dereferenced may be stale if the line discipline
    is changing via ioctl(TIOCSETD) or hangup.
    
    Wait for the line discipline reference (just like read() or write())
    to retrieve the "current" line discipline id.

    tty: Fix recursive deadlock in tty_perform_flush()
    
    tty_perform_flush() can deadlock when called while holding
    a line discipline reference. By definition, all ldisc drivers
    hold a ldisc reference, so calls originating from ldisc drivers
    must not block for a ldisc reference.
    
    The deadlock can occur when:
      CPU 0                    |  CPU 1
                               |
    tty_ldisc_ref(tty)         |
    ....                       | <line discipline halted>
    tty_ldisc_ref_wait(tty)    |
                               |
    
    CPU 0 cannot progess because it cannot obtain an ldisc reference
    with the line discipline has been halted (thus no new references
    are granted).
    CPU 1 cannot progress because an outstanding ldisc reference
    has not been released.
    
    An in-tree call-tree audit of tty_perform_flush() [1] shows 5
    ldisc drivers calling tty_perform_flush() indirectly via
    n_tty_ioctl_helper() and 2 ldisc drivers calling directly.
    A single tty driver safely uses the function.
    
    [1]
    Recursive usage:
    
    /* These functions are line discipline ioctls and thus
     * recursive wrt line discipline references */
    
    tty_perform_flush() - ./drivers/tty/tty_ioctl.c

    tty: Fix race condition if flushing tty flip buffers
    
    As Ilya Zykov identified in his patch 'PROBLEM: Race condition in
    tty buffer's function flush_to_ldisc()', a race condition exists
    which allows a parallel flush_to_ldisc() to flush and free the tty
    flip buffers while those buffers are in-use. For example,
    
      CPU 0                         |  CPU 1                                  |  CPU 2
                                    | flush_to_ldisc()                        |
                                    |  grab spin lock                         |
    tty_buffer_flush()              |                                         | flush_to_ldisc()
     wait for spin lock             |                                         |  wait for spin lock
                                    |   if (!test_and_set_bit(TTYP_FLUSHING)) |
                                    |    while (next flip buffer)             |
                                    |     ...                                 |
                                    |     drop spin lock                      |
      grab spin lock                |                                         |
       if (test_bit(TTYP_FLUSHING)) |                                         |
        set_bit(TTYP_FLUSHPENDING)  |      receive_buf()                      |
        drop spin lock              |                                         |
                                    |                                         |   grab spin lock
                                    |                                         |    if (!test_and_set_bit(TTYP_FLUSHING))
                                    |                                         |    if (test_bit(TTYP_FLUSHPENDING))
                                    |                                         |    __tty_buffer_flush()
    
    CPU 2 has just flushed and freed all tty flip buffers while CPU 1 is
    transferring data from the head flip buffer.
    
    The original patch was rejected under the assumption that parallel
    flush_to_ldisc() was not possible. Because of necessary changes to
    the workqueue api, work items can execute in parallel on SMP.
    
    This patch differs slightly from the original patch by testing for
    a pending flush _after_ each receive_buf(), since TTYP_FLUSHPENDING
    can only be set while the lock is dropped around receive_buf().

    tty: prevent unnecessary work queue lock checking on flip buffer copy
    
    When low_latency flag is set the TTY receive flip buffer is copied to the
    line discipline directly instead of using a work queue in the background.
    Therefor only in case a workqueue is actually used for copying data to the
    line discipline we'll have to flush the workqueue.
    
    This prevents unnecessary spin lock/unlock on the workqueue spin lock that
    can cause additional scheduling overhead on a PREEMPT_RT system. On a 200
    MHz AT91SAM9261 processor setup this fixes about 100us of scheduling
    overhead on the TTY read call.

    net: cdc_ncm: Fix TX zero padding
    
    The zero padding that is added to NTB's does
    not zero the memory correctly.
    This is because the skb_put modifies the value
    of skb_out->len which results in the memset
    command not setting any memory to zero as
    (ctx->tx_max - skb_out->len) == 0.
    
    I have resolved this by storing the size of
    the memory to be zeroed before the skb_put
    and using this in the memset call.

    ipv4, ipv6: ensure raw socket message is big enough to hold an IP header
    
    raw_send_hdrinc() and rawv6_send_hdrinc() expect that the buffer copied
    from the userspace contains the IPv4/IPv6 header, so if too few bytes are
    copied, parts of the header may remain uninitialized.

    netfilter: don't track fragmented packets
    
    Andrey reports syzkaller splat caused by
    
    NF_CT_ASSERT(!ip_is_fragment(ip_hdr(skb)));
    
    in ipv4 nat.  But this assertion (and the comment) are wrong, this function
    does see fragments when IP_NODEFRAG setsockopt is used.
    
    As conntrack doesn't track packets without complete l4 header, only the
    first fragment is tracked.
    
    Because applying nat to first packet but not the rest makes no sense this
    also turns off tracking of all fragments.

    ipv6: avoid write to a possibly cloned skb
    
    ip6_fragment, in case skb has a fraglist, checks if the
    skb is cloned.  If it is, it will move to the 'slow path' and allocates
    new skbs for each fragment.
    
    However, right before entering the slowpath loop, it updates the
    nexthdr value of the last ipv6 extension header to NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT,
    to account for the fragment header that will be inserted in the new
    ipv6-fragment skbs.
    
    In case original skb is cloned this munges nexthdr value of another
    skb.  Avoid this by doing the nexthdr update for each of the new fragment
    skbs separately.
    
    This was observed with tcpdump on a bridge device where netfilter ipv6
    reassembly is active:  tcpdump shows malformed fragment headers as
    the l4 header (icmpv6, tcp, etc). is decoded as a fragment header.

    tty: n_hdlc: get rid of racy n_hdlc.tbuf
    
    Currently N_HDLC line discipline uses a self-made singly linked list for
    data buffers and has n_hdlc.tbuf pointer for buffer retransmitting after
    an error.
    
    The commit be10eb7589337e5defbe214dae038a53dd21add8
    ("tty: n_hdlc add buffer flushing") introduced racy access to n_hdlc.tbuf.
    After tx error concurrent flush_tx_queue() and n_hdlc_send_frames() can put
    one data buffer to tx_free_buf_list twice. That causes double free in
    n_hdlc_release().
    
    Let's use standard kernel linked list and get rid of n_hdlc.tbuf:
    in case of tx error put current data buffer after the head of tx_buf_list.

    The class of 4 n_hdls buf locks is the same because a single function

    net: mangle zero checksum in skb_checksum_help()
    
    Sending zero checksum is ok for TCP, but not for UDP.
    
    UDPv6 receiver should by default drop a frame with a 0 checksum,
    and UDPv4 would not verify the checksum and might accept a corrupted
    packet.
    
    Simply replace such checksum by 0xffff, regardless of transport.
    
    This error was caught on SIT tunnels, but seems generic.

    route: do not cache fib route info on local routes with oif
    
    For local routes that require a particular output interface we do not want
    to cache the result.  Caching the result causes incorrect behaviour when
    there are multiple source addresses on the interface.  The end result
    being that if the intended recipient is waiting on that interface for the
    packet he won't receive it because it will be delivered on the loopback
    interface and the IP_PKTINFO ipi_ifindex will be set to the loopback
    interface as well.
    
    This can be tested by running a program such as "dhcp_release" which
    attempts to inject a packet on a particular interface so that it is
    received by another program on the same board.  The receiving process
    should see an IP_PKTINFO ipi_ifndex value of the source interface
    (e.g., eth1) instead of the loopback interface (e.g., lo).  The packet
    will still appear on the loopback interface in tcpdump but the important
    aspect is that the CMSG info is correct.
    
    Sample dhcp_release command line:
    
       dhcp_release eth1 192.168.204.222 02:11:33:22:44:66

    sock: fix sendmmsg for partial sendmsg
    
    [ Upstream commit 3023898b7d4aac65987bd2f485cc22390aae6f78 ]
    
    Do not send the next message in sendmmsg for partial sendmsg
    invocations.
    
    sendmmsg assumes that it can continue sending the next message
    when the return value of the individual sendmsg invocations
    is positive. It results in corrupting the data for TCP,
    SCTP, and UNIX streams.
    
    For example, sendmmsg([["abcd"], ["efgh"]]) can result in a stream
    of "aefgh" if the first sendmsg invocation sends only the first
    byte while the second sendmsg goes through.
    
    Datagram sockets either send the entire datagram or fail, so
    this patch affects only sockets of type SOCK_STREAM and
    SOCK_SEQPACKET.

    ext4: fix mballoc breakage with 64k block size
    
    'border' variable is set to a value of 2 times the block size of the
    underlying filesystem. With 64k block size, the resulting value won't
    fit into a 16-bit variable. Hence this commit changes the data type of
    'border' to 'unsigned int'.

    ext4: don't call ext4_should_journal_data() on the journal inode
    
    If ext4_fill_super() fails early, it's possible for ext4_evict_inode()
    to call ext4_should_journal_data() before superblock options and flags
    are fully set up.  In that case, the iput() on the journal inode can
    end up causing a BUG().
    
    Work around this problem by reordering the tests so we only call
    ext4_should_journal_data() after we know it's not the journal inode.

    ext4: check for extents that wrap around
    
    An extent with lblock = 4294967295 and len = 1 will pass the
    ext4_valid_extent() test:
    
            ext4_lblk_t last = lblock + len - 1;
    
            if (len == 0 || lblock > last)
                    return 0;
    
    since last = 4294967295 + 1 - 1 = 4294967295. This would later trigger
    the BUG_ON(es->es_lblk + es->es_len < es->es_lblk) in ext4_es_end().
    
    We can simplify it by removing the - 1 altogether and changing the test
    to use lblock + len <= lblock, since now if len = 0, then lblock + 0 ==
    lblock and it fails, and if len > 0 then lblock + len > lblock in order
    to pass (i.e. it doesn't overflow).

    ext4: fix hang when processing corrupted orphaned inode list
    
    If the orphaned inode list contains inode #5, ext4_iget() returns a
    bad inode (since the bootloader inode should never be referenced
    directly).  Because of the bad inode, we end up processing the inode
    repeatedly and this hangs the machine.
    
    This can be reproduced via:
    
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 100
       debugfs -w -R "ssv last_orphan 5" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -o loop /tmp/foo.img /mnt
    
    (But don't do this if you are using an unpatched kernel if you care
    about the system staying functional.  :-)
    
    This bug was found by the port of American Fuzzy Lop into the kernel
    to find file system problems[1].  (Since it *only* happens if inode #5
    shows up on the orphan list --- 3, 7, 8, etc. won't do it, it's not
    surprising that AFL needed two hours before it found it.)

    swapfile: fix memory corruption via malformed swapfile
    
    commit dd111be69114cc867f8e826284559bfbc1c40e37 upstream.
    
    When root activates a swap partition whose header has the wrong
    endianness, nr_badpages elements of badpages are swabbed before
    nr_badpages has been checked, leading to a buffer overrun of up to 8GB.
    
    This normally is not a security issue because it can only be exploited
    by root (more specifically, a process with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or the ability
    to modify a swap file/partition), and such a process can already e.g.
    modify swapped-out memory of any other userspace process on the system.

    ubifs: Fix journal replay wrt. xattr nodes
    
    When replaying the journal it can happen that a journal entry points to
    a garbage collected node.
    This is the case when a power-cut occurred between a garbage collect run
    and a commit. In such a case nodes have to be read using the failable
    read functions to detect whether the found node matches what we expect.
    
    One corner case was forgotten, when the journal contains an entry to
    remove an inode all xattrs have to be removed too. UBIFS models xattr
    like directory entries, so the TNC code iterates over
    all xattrs of the inode and removes them too. This code re-uses the
    functions for walking directories and calls ubifs_tnc_next_ent().
    ubifs_tnc_next_ent() expects to be used only after the journal and
    aborts when a node does not match the expected result. This behavior can
    render an UBIFS volume unmountable after a power-cut when xattrs are
    used.
    
    Fix this issue by using failable read functions in ubifs_tnc_next_ent()
    too when replaying the journal.

    ubifs: Abort readdir upon error
    
    commit c83ed4c9dbb358b9e7707486e167e940d48bfeed upstream.
    
    If UBIFS is facing an error while walking a directory, it reports this
    error and ubifs_readdir() returns the error code. But the VFS readdir
    logic does not make the getdents system call fail in all cases. When the
    readdir cursor indicates that more entries are present, the system call
    will just return and the libc wrapper will try again since it also
    knows that more entries are present.
    This causes the libc wrapper to busy loop for ever when a directory is
    corrupted on UBIFS.
    A common approach do deal with corrupted directory entries is
    skipping them by setting the cursor to the next entry. On UBIFS this
    approach is not possible since we cannot compute the next directory
    entry cursor position without reading the current entry. So all we can
    do is setting the cursor to the "no more entries" position and make
    getdents exit.

    scsi: Fix use-after-free
    
    This patch fixes one use-after-free report[1] by KASAN.
    
    In __scsi_scan_target(), when a type 31 device is probed,
    SCSI_SCAN_TARGET_PRESENT is returned and the target will be scanned
    again.
    
    Inside the following scsi_report_lun_scan(), one new scsi_device
    instance is allocated, and scsi_probe_and_add_lun() is called again to
    probe the target and still see type 31 device, finally
    __scsi_remove_device() is called to remove & free the device at the end
    of scsi_probe_and_add_lun(), so cause use-after-free in
    scsi_report_lun_scan().
    
    And the following SCSI log can be observed:
    
            scsi 0:0:2:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY pass 1 length 36
            scsi 0:0:2:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY successful with code 0x0

    mmc: block: don't use CMD23 with very old MMC cards
    
    CMD23 aka SET_BLOCK_COUNT was introduced with MMC v3.1.
    Older versions of the specification allowed to terminate
    multi-block transfers only with CMD12.
    
    The patch fixes the following problem:
    
      mmc0: new MMC card at address 0001
      mmcblk0: mmc0:0001 SDMB-16 15.3 MiB

    keys: Guard against null match function in keyring_search_aux()
    
    The "dead" key type has no match operation, and a search for keys of
    this type can cause a null dereference in keyring_search_aux().
    keyring_search() has a check for this, but request_keyring_and_link()
    does not.  Move the check into keyring_search_aux(), covering both of
    them.
    
    This was fixed upstream by commit c06cfb08b88d ("KEYS: Remove
    key_type::match in favour of overriding default by match_preparse"),
    part of a series of large changes that are not suitable for
    backporting.

    ipv6: check sk sk_type and protocol early in ip_mroute_set/getsockopt
    
    Commit 5e1859fbcc3c ("ipv4: ipmr: various fixes and cleanups") fixed
    the issue for ipv4 ipmr:
    
      ip_mroute_setsockopt() & ip_mroute_getsockopt() should not
      access/set raw_sk(sk)->ipmr_table before making sure the socket
      is a raw socket, and protocol is IGMP
    
    The same fix should be done for ipv6 ipmr as well.
    
    This patch can fix the panic caused by overwriting the same offset
    as ipmr_table as in raw_sk(sk) when accessing other type's socket
    by ip_mroute_setsockopt().

    ipv4: keep skb->dst around in presence of IP options
    
    Andrey Konovalov got crashes in ip_options_echo() when a NULL skb->dst

    ipv4_pktinfo_prepare() should not drop the dst if (evil) IP options
    are present.
    
    We could refine the test to the presence of ts_needtime or srr,

    net: socket: fix recvmmsg not returning error from sock_error
    
    Commit 34b88a68f26a ("net: Fix use after free in the recvmmsg exit path"),
    changed the exit path of recvmmsg to always return the datagrams
    variable and modified the error paths to set the variable to the error
    code returned by recvmsg if necessary.
    
    However in the case sock_error returned an error, the error code was
    then ignored, and recvmmsg returned 0.
    
    Change the error path of recvmmsg to correctly return the error code
    of sock_error.
    
    The bug was triggered by using recvmmsg on a CAN interface which was
    not up. Linux 4.6 and later return 0 in this case while earlier
    releases returned -ENETDOWN.

    net: ping: check minimum size on ICMP header length
    
    Prior to commit c0371da6047a ("put iov_iter into msghdr") in v3.19, there
    was no check that the iovec contained enough bytes for an ICMP header,
    and the read loop would walk across neighboring stack contents. Since the
    iov_iter conversion, bad arguments are noticed, but the returned error is
    EFAULT. Returning EINVAL is a clearer error and also solves the problem
    prior to v3.19.
    
    This was found using trinity with KASAN on v3.18:

    tcp: avoid infinite loop in tcp_splice_read()
    
    Splicing from TCP socket is vulnerable when a packet with URG flag is
    received and stored into receive queue.
    
    __tcp_splice_read() returns 0, and sk_wait_data() immediately
    returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.
    
    This is a nice way to burn cpu (aka infinite loop) and trigger
    soft lockups.
    
    Again, this gem was found by syzkaller tool.

    dccp: fix freeing skb too early for IPV6_RECVPKTINFO
    
    In the current DCCP implementation an skb for a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet
    is forcibly freed via __kfree_skb in dccp_rcv_state_process if
    dccp_v6_conn_request successfully returns.
    
    However, if IPV6_RECVPKTINFO is set on a socket, the address of the skb
    is saved to ireq->pktopts and the ref count for skb is incremented in
    dccp_v6_conn_request, so skb is still in use. Nevertheless, it gets freed
    in dccp_rcv_state_process.
    
    Fix by calling consume_skb instead of doing goto discard and therefore
    calling __kfree_skb.
    
    Similar fixes for TCP:
    
    fb7e2399ec17f1004c0e0ccfd17439f8759ede01 [TCP]: skb is unexpectedly freed.

    MIPS: Disable stack checks on MIPS kernels
    
    Disable stack checking on MIPS kernels.  Some distribution toolchains
    might pass the -fstack-check option to gcc.  This results in a
    store-doubleword instruction being emitted at the top of all
    functions that checks the available stack space.  E.g.,
    
      a80000000001d740 <per_cpu_init>:
      a80000000001d740:       ffa0bfc0        sd      zero,-16448(sp)
      a80000000001d744:       2405ffc9        li      a1,-55
      a80000000001d748:       67bdffc0        daddiu  sp,sp,-64
    
    Generally, this is undesirable, and especially on the SGI IP27
    platform, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference in
    '_raw_spin_lock_irq' during early init.

    net, sched: fix soft lockup in tc_classify
    
    Shahar reported a soft lockup in tc_classify(), where we run into an
    endless loop when walking the classifier chain due to tp->next == tp
    which is a state we should never run into. The issue only seems to
    trigger under load in the tc control path.
    
    What happens is that in tc_ctl_tfilter(), thread A allocates a new
    tp, initializes it, sets tp_created to 1, and calls into tp->ops->change()
    with it. In that classifier callback we had to unlock/lock the rtnl
    mutex and returned with -EAGAIN. One reason why we need to drop there
    is, for example, that we need to request an action module to be loaded.
    
    This happens via tcf_exts_validate() -> tcf_action_init/_1() meaning
    after we loaded and found the requested action, we need to redo the
    whole request so we don't race against others. While we had to unlock
    rtnl in that time, thread B's request was processed next on that CPU.
    Thread B added a new tp instance successfully to the classifier chain.
    When thread A returned grabbing the rtnl mutex again, propagating -EAGAIN
    and destroying its tp instance which never got linked, we goto replay
    and redo A's request.
    
    This time when walking the classifier chain in tc_ctl_tfilter() for
    checking for existing tp instances we had a priority match and found
    the tp instance that was created and linked by thread B. Now calling
    again into tp->ops->change() with that tp was successful and returned
    without error.
    
    tp_created was never cleared in the second round, thus kernel thinks
    that we need to link it into the classifier chain (once again). tp and
    *back point to the same object due to the match we had earlier on. Thus
    for thread B's already public tp, we reset tp->next to tp itself and
    link it into the chain, which eventually causes the mentioned endless
    loop in tc_classify() once a packet hits the data path.
    
    Fix is to clear tp_created at the beginning of each request, also when
    we replay it. On the paths that can cause -EAGAIN we already destroy
    the original tp instance we had and on replay we really need to start
    from scratch. It seems that this issue was first introduced in commit
    12186be7d2e1 ("net_cls: fix unconfigured struct tcf_proto keeps chaining
    and avoid kernel panic when we use cls_cgroup").

    cdc_ether: Fix handling connection notification
    
    Commit bfe9b9d2df66 ("cdc_ether: Improve ZTE MF823/831/910 handling")
    introduced a work-around in usbnet_cdc_status() for devices that exported
    cdc carrier on twice on connect. Before the commit, this behavior caused
    the link state to be incorrect. It was assumed that all CDC Ethernet
    devices would either export this behavior, or send one off and then one on
    notification (which seems to be the default behavior).
    
    Unfortunately, it turns out multiple devices sends a connection
    notification multiple times per second (via an interrupt), even when
    connection state does not change. This has been observed with several
    different USB LAN dongles (at least), for example 13b1:0041 (Linksys).
    After bfe9b9d2df66, the link state has been set as down and then up for
    each notification. This has caused a flood of Netlink NEWLINK messages and
    syslog to be flooded with messages similar to:
    
    cdc_ether 2-1:2.0 eth1: kevent 12 may have been dropped
    
    This commit fixes the behavior by reverting usbnet_cdc_status() to how it
    was before bfe9b9d2df66. The work-around has been moved to a separate
    status-function which is only called when a known, affect device is
    detected.
    
    v1->v2:
    
    * Do not open-code netif_carrier_ok() (thanks Henning Schild).
    * Call netif_carrier_off() instead of usb_link_change(). This prevents
    calling schedule_work() twice without giving the work queue a chance to be
    processed (thanks Bjørn Mork).

    gro: Disable frag0 optimization on IPv6 ext headers
    
    The GRO fast path caches the frag0 address.  This address becomes
    invalid if frag0 is modified by pskb_may_pull or its variants.
    So whenever that happens we must disable the frag0 optimization.
    
    This is usually done through the combination of gro_header_hard
    and gro_header_slow, however, the IPv6 extension header path did
    the pulling directly and would continue to use the GRO fast path
    incorrectly.
    
    This patch fixes it by disabling the fast path when we enter the
    IPv6 extension header path.

    The GRO path has a fast-path where we avoid calling pskb_may_pull
    and pskb_expand by directly accessing frag0.  However, this should
    only be done if we have enough tailroom in the skb as otherwise
    we'll have to expand it later anyway.

    igmp: Make igmp group member RFC 3376 compliant
    
    5.2. Action on Reception of a Query
    
     When a system receives a Query, it does not respond immediately.
     Instead, it delays its response by a random amount of time, bounded
     by the Max Resp Time value derived from the Max Resp Code in the
     received Query message.  A system may receive a variety of Queries on
     different interfaces and of different kinds (e.g., General Queries,
     Group-Specific Queries, and Group-and-Source-Specific Queries), each
     of which may require its own delayed response.
    
     Before scheduling a response to a Query, the system must first
     consider previously scheduled pending responses and in many cases
     schedule a combined response.  Therefore, the system must be able to
     maintain the following state:
    
     o A timer per interface for scheduling responses to General Queries.
    
     o A per-group and interface timer for scheduling responses to Group-
       Specific and Group-and-Source-Specific Queries.
    
     o A per-group and interface list of sources to be reported in the
       response to a Group-and-Source-Specific Query.
    
     When a new Query with the Router-Alert option arrives on an
     interface, provided the system has state to report, a delay for a
     response is randomly selected in the range (0, [Max Resp Time]) where
     Max Resp Time is derived from Max Resp Code in the received Query
     message.  The following rules are then used to determine if a Report
     needs to be scheduled and the type of Report to schedule.  The rules
     are considered in order and only the first matching rule is applied.
    
     1. If there is a pending response to a previous General Query
        scheduled sooner than the selected delay, no additional response
        needs to be scheduled.
    
     2. If the received Query is a General Query, the interface timer is
        used to schedule a response to the General Query after the
        selected delay.  Any previously pending response to a General
        Query is canceled.
    --8<--
    
    Currently the timer is rearmed with new random expiration time for
    every incoming query regardless of possibly already pending report.
    Which is not aligned with the above RFE.
    It also might happen that higher rate of incoming queries can
    postpone the report after the expiration time of the first query
    causing group membership loss.
    
    Now the per interface general query timer is rearmed only
    when there is no pending report already scheduled on that interface or
    the newly selected expiration time is before the already pending
    scheduled report.

    instructions, and branch whilst the current write address doesn't equal
    the end of the .bss section minus the size of a long integer. The .bss
    section always begins at a long-aligned address and we always increment
    the write pointer by the size of a long integer - we therefore rely upon
    the .bss section ending at a long-aligned address. If this is not the
    case then the long-aligned write address can never be equal to the
    non-long-aligned end address & we will continue to increment past the
    end of the .bss section, attempting to zero the rest of memory.
    
    Despite this requirement that .bss end at a long-aligned address we pass
    0 as the end alignment requirement to the BSS_SECTION macro and thus
    don't guarantee any particular alignment, allowing us to hit the error
    condition described above.
    
    Fix this by instead passing 8 bytes as the end alignment argument to
    the BSS_SECTION macro, ensuring that the end of the .bss section is
    always at least long-aligned.

    MIPS: Fix special case in 64 bit IP checksumming.
    
    For certain arguments such as saddr = 0xc0a8fd60, daddr = 0xc0a8fda1,
    len = 80, proto = 17, sum = 0x7eae049d there will be a carry when folding
    the intermediate 64 bit checksum to 32 bit but the code doesn't add the
    carry back to the one'c complement sum, thus an incorrect result will
    be generated.

    MIPS: MT: Move an assignment for the variable "retval" in mipsmt_sys_sched_setaffinity()
    
    A local variable was set to an error code in one case before a concrete
    error situation was detected. Thus move the corresponding assignment into
    an if branch to indicate a software failure there.
    
    This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

    net: fix bogus cast in skb_pagelen() and use unsigned variables
    
    1) cast to "int" is unnecessary:
       u8 will be promoted to int before decrementing,
       small positive numbers fit into "int", so their values won't be changed
       during promotion.
    
       Once everything is int including loop counters, signedness doesn't
       matter: 32-bit operations will stay 32-bit operations.
    
       But! Someone tried to make this loop smart by making everything of
       the same type apparently in an attempt to optimise it.
       Do the optimization, just differently.
       Do the cast where it matters. :^)
    
    2) frag size is unsigned entity and sum of fragments sizes is also
       unsigned.
    
    Make everything unsigned, leave no MOVSX instruction behind.

    l2tp: fix racy SOCK_ZAPPED flag check in l2tp_ip{,6}_bind()
    
    Lock socket before checking the SOCK_ZAPPED flag in l2tp_ip6_bind().
    Without lock, a concurrent call could modify the socket flags between
    the sock_flag(sk, SOCK_ZAPPED) test and the lock_sock() call. This way,
    a socket could be inserted twice in l2tp_ip6_bind_table. Releasing it
    would then leave a stale pointer there, generating use-after-free
    errors when walking through the list or modifying adjacent entries.

    tcp: fix wrong checksum calculation on MTU probing
    
    With TCP MTU probing enabled and offload TX checksumming disabled,
    tcp_mtu_probe() calculated the wrong checksum when a fragment being copied
    into the probe's SKB had an odd length. This was caused by the direct use
    of skb_copy_and_csum_bits() to calculate the checksum, as it pads the
    fragment being copied, if needed. When this fragment was not the last, a
    subsequent call used the previous checksum without considering this
    padding.
    
    The effect was a stale connection in one way, as even retransmissions
    wouldn't solve the problem, because the checksum was never recalculated for
    the full SKB length.

    xfrm: make local error reporting more robust
    
    In xfrm4 and xfrm6 we need to take care about sockets of the other
    address family. This could happen because a 6in4 or 4in6 tunnel could
    get protected by ipsec.
    
    Because we don't want to have a run-time dependency on ipv6 when only
    using ipv4 xfrm we have to embed a pointer to the correct local_error
    function in xfrm_state_afinet and look it up when returning an error
    depending on the socket address family.

    x->replay_esn->replay_window is zero (and return if so).  However,
    one of them, xfrm_replay_advance_bmp(), divides by that value (in the

    a divide-by-zero exception.  Some compilers will also assume that the
    earlier division means the value cannot be zero later, and thus will
    eliminate the subsequent zero check as dead code.
    
    This patch moves the division to after the check.

    udp: must lock the socket in udp_disconnect()
    
    Baozeng Ding reported KASAN traces showing uses after free in
    udp_lib_get_port() and other related UDP functions.
    
    A CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y kernel would eventually crash.
    
    I could write a reproducer with two threads doing :
    
    static int sock_fd;
    static void *thr1(void *arg)
    {
            for (;;) {
                    connect(sock_fd, (const struct sockaddr *)arg,
                            sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
            }
    }
    
    static void *thr2(void *arg)
    {
            struct sockaddr_in unspec;
    
            for (;;) {
                    memset(&unspec, 0, sizeof(unspec));
                    connect(sock_fd, (const struct sockaddr *)&unspec,
                            sizeof(unspec));
            }
    }
    
    Problem is that udp_disconnect() could run without holding socket lock,
    and this was causing list corruptions.

    We still keep a limit because anything above 2048

    A crash is observed when a decrypted packet is processed in receive

    0xAAAAAAAAAAA
    
    Following are the sequence of events observed -
    
    - Encrypted packet in receive path from netdevice is queued
    - Encrypted packet queued for decryption (asynchronous)
    - Netdevice brought down and freed
    - Packet is decrypted and returned through callback in esp_input_done
    - Packet is queued again for process in network stack using netif_rx
    
    Since the device appears to have been freed, the dereference of
    skb->dev in get_rps_cpus() leads to an unhandled page fault
    exception.
    
    Fix this by holding on to device reference when queueing packets
    asynchronously and releasing the reference on call back return.

    USB: usbip: fix potential out-of-bounds write
    
    Fix potential out-of-bounds write to urb->transfer_buffer
    usbip handles network communication directly in the kernel. When receiving a
    packet from its peer, usbip code parses headers according to protocol. As
    part of this parsing urb->actual_length is filled. Since the input for
    urb->actual_length comes from the network, it should be treated as untrusted.
    Any entity controlling the network may put any value in the input and the
    preallocated urb->transfer_buffer may not be large enough to hold the data.
    Thus, the malicious entity is able to write arbitrary data to kernel memory.

    USB: avoid left shift by -1
    
    UBSAN complains about a left shift by -1 in proc_do_submiturb().  This
    can occur when an URB is submitted for a bulk or control endpoint on
    a high-speed device, since the code doesn't bother to check the
    endpoint type; normally only interrupt or isochronous endpoints have
    a nonzero bInterval value.
    
    Aside from the fact that the operation is illegal, it shouldn't matter
    because the result isn't used.  Still, in theory it could cause a
    hardware exception or other problem, so we should work around it.
    This patch avoids doing the left shift unless the shift amount is >= 0.
    
    The same piece of code has another problem.  When checking the device
    speed (the exponential encoding for interrupt endpoints is used only
    by high-speed or faster devices), we need to look for speed >=
    USB_SPEED_SUPER as well as speed == USB_SPEED HIGH.  The patch adds
    this check.

    USB: remove race condition in usbfs/libusb when using reap-after-disconnect
    
    Hans de Goede has reported a difficulty in the Linux port of libusb.
    When a device is removed, the poll() system call in usbfs starts
    returning POLLERR as soon as udev->state is set to
    USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED, but the outstanding URBs are not available for
    reaping until some time later (after usbdev_remove() has been called).
    This is awkward for libusb or other usbfs clients, although not an
    insuperable problem.
    
    At any rate, it's easy to change usbfs so that it returns POLLHUP as
    soon as the state becomes USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED but it doesn't return
    POLLERR until after the outstanding URBs have completed.  That's what
    this patch does; it uses the fact that ps->list is always on the
    dev->filelist list until usbdev_remove() takes it off, which happens
    after all the outstanding URBs have been cancelled.

    USB: hub: change the locking in hub_activate
    
    The locking in hub_activate() is not adequate to provide full mutual

    hub_pre_reset() and hub_event()) hold the lock to the hub's
    usb_device.

    USB: hub: fix up early-exit pathway in hub_activate
    
    The early-exit pathway in hub_activate, added by commit e50293ef9775
    ("USB: fix invalid memory access in hub_activate()") needs
    improvement.  It duplicates code that is already present at the end of
    the subroutine, and it neglects to undo the effect of a
    usb_autopm_get_interface_no_resume() call.
    
    This patch fixes both problems by making the early-exit pathway jump
    directly to the end of the subroutine.  It simplifies the code at the
    end by merging two conditionals that actually test the same condition
    although they appear different: If type < HUB_INIT3 then type must be
    either HUB_INIT2 or HUB_INIT, and it can't be HUB_INIT because in that

    usb: hub: Fix unbalanced reference count/memory leak/deadlocks
    
    Memory leak and unbalanced reference count:
    
    If the hub gets disconnected while the core is still activating it, this
    can result in leaking memory of few USB structures.
    
    This will happen if we have done a kref_get() from hub_activate() and
    scheduled a delayed work item for HUB_INIT2/3. Now if hub_disconnect()
    gets called before the delayed work expires, then we will cancel the
    work from hub_quiesce(), but wouldn't do a kref_put(). And so the
    unbalance.
    
    kmemleak reports this as (with the commit e50293ef9775 backported to

    qmi_wwan: add support for Quectel EC21 and EC25
    
    The Quectel EC21 and EC25 need the same "set DTR" request as devices
    based on the MDM9230 chipset, but has no USB3 support. Our best guess
    is that the "set DTR" functionality depends on chipset and/or
    baseband firmware generation. But USB3 is still an optional feature.
    
    Since we cannot enable this unconditionally for all older devices, and
    there doesn't appear to be anything we can use in the USB descriptors
    to identify these chips, we are forced to use a device specific quirk
    flag.

    cdc-wdm: Clear read pipeline in case of error
    
    Implemented queued response handling. This queue is processed every time the
    WDM_READ flag is cleared.
    
    In case of a read error, userspace may not actually read the data, since the
    driver returns an error through wdm_poll. After this, the underlying device may
    attempt to send us more data, but the queue is not processed. While userspace is
    also blocked, because the read error is never cleared.
    
    After this patch, we proactively process the queue on a read error. If there was
    an outstanding response to handle, that will clear the error (or go through the
    same logic again, if another read error occurs). If there was no outstanding
    response, this will bring the queue size back to 0, unblocking a future response
    from the underlying device.

    cdc-wdm: fix "out-of-sync" due to missing notifications
    
    The driver enforces a strict one-to-one relationship between the
    received RESPONSE_AVAILABLE notifications and messages read from
    the device. At the same time, it will cancel the interrupt URB
    when there is no client holding the character device open.
    
    Many devices do not cope well with this behaviour.  They maintain
    a FIFO queue of messages, and send notifications on a best effort
    basis.  Messages are queued regardless of whether the notification
    is successful or not. So if the driver loses a single notification,
    which can easily happen when the interrupt URB is cancelled, then
    the device and driver becomes out-of-sync. New messages end up
    at the end of the queue, while the associated notification makes
    the driver read only the first message from the queue.
    
    This state is permanent from a user point of view. There is no
    no way to flush the device queue without resetting the device or
    using another driver.
    
    The problem is easy to hit with current QMI and MBIM command line
    tools, which typically close the character device after seeing
    the reply they expect. Any pending unsolicited messages from the
    device will then trigger the driver bug.
    
    Fix by always reading all queued messages from the device when
    the notification URB is first submitted.  This is expected to
    end with an -EPIPE status when there are no more pending
    messages, so demote the printk associated with -EPIPE to debug
    level.
    
    The workaround has been tested on a large number of different MBIM
    and QMI devices, as well as the Ericsson F5521gw and H5321gw modems
    with real Device Management functions.

    ipv6: correctly add local routes when lo goes up
    
    The goal of the patch is to fix this scenario:
     ip link add dummy1 type dummy
     ip link set dummy1 up
     ip link set lo down ; ip link set lo up
    
    After that sequence, the local route to the link layer address of dummy1 is
    not there anymore.
    
    When the loopback is set down, all local routes are deleted by
    addrconf_ifdown()/rt6_ifdown(). At this time, the rt6_info entry still
    exists, because the corresponding idev has a reference on it. After the rcu
    grace period, dst_rcu_free() is called, and thus ___dst_free(), which will
    set obsolete to DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD.
    
    In this case, init_loopback() is called before dst_rcu_free(), thus
    obsolete is still sets to something <= 0. So, the function doesn't add the
    route again. To avoid that race, let's check the rt6 refcnt instead.

    sched/core: Fix a race between try_to_wake_up() and a woken up task
    
    The origin of the issue I've seen is related to
    a missing memory barrier between check for task->state and
    the check for task->on_rq.
    
    The task being woken up is already awake from a schedule()
    and is doing the following:
    
            do {
                    schedule()
                    set_current_state(TASK_(UN)INTERRUPTIBLE);
            } while (!cond);
    
    The waker, actually gets stuck doing the following in
    try_to_wake_up():
    
            while (p->on_cpu)
                    cpu_relax();
    
    Analysis:
    
    The instance I've seen involves the following race:
    
     CPU1                                   CPU2
    
     while () {
       if (cond)
         break;
       do {
         schedule();
         set_current_state(TASK_UN..)
       } while (!cond);
                                            wakeup_routine()
                                              spin_lock_irqsave(wait_lock)
       raw_spin_lock_irqsave(wait_lock)       wake_up_process()
     }                                        try_to_wake_up()
     set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);         ..
     list_del(&waiter.list);
    
    CPU2 wakes up CPU1, but before it can get the wait_lock and set
    current state to TASK_RUNNING the following occurs:
    
     CPU3
     wakeup_routine()
     raw_spin_lock_irqsave(wait_lock)
     if (!list_empty)
       wake_up_process()
       try_to_wake_up()
       raw_spin_lock_irqsave(p->pi_lock)
       ..
       if (p->on_rq && ttwu_wakeup())
       ..
       while (p->on_cpu)
         cpu_relax()
       ..
    
    CPU3 tries to wake up the task on CPU1 again since it finds
    it on the wait_queue, CPU1 is spinning on wait_lock, but immediately
    after CPU2, CPU3 got it.
    
    CPU3 checks the state of p on CPU1, it is TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and
    the task is spinning on the wait_lock. Interestingly since p->on_rq
    is checked under pi_lock, I've noticed that try_to_wake_up() finds
    p->on_rq to be 0. This was the most confusing bit of the analysis,
    but p->on_rq is changed under runqueue lock, rq_lock, the p->on_rq
    check is not reliable without this fix IMHO. The race is visible
    (based on the analysis) only when ttwu_queue() does a remote wakeup
    via ttwu_queue_remote. In which case the p->on_rq change is not
    done uder the pi_lock.
    
    The result is that after a while the entire system locks up on
    the raw_spin_irqlock_save(wait_lock) and the holder spins infintely
    
    Reproduction of the issue:
    
    The issue can be reproduced after a long run on my system with 80
    threads and having to tweak available memory to very low and running
    memory stress-ng mmapfork test. It usually takes a long time to
    reproduce. I am trying to work on a test case that can reproduce
    the issue faster, but thats work in progress. I am still testing the
    changes on my still in a loop and the tests seem OK thus far.
    
    Big thanks to Benjamin and Nick for helping debug this as well.
    Ben helped catch the missing barrier, Nick caught every missing
    bit in my theory.

    net: avoid sk_forward_alloc overflows
    
    A malicious TCP receiver, sending SACK, can force the sender to split
    skbs in write queue and increase its memory usage.
    
    Then, when socket is closed and its write queue purged, we might
    overflow sk_forward_alloc (It becomes negative)
    
    sk_mem_reclaim() does nothing in this case, and more than 2GB
    are leaked from TCP perspective (tcp_memory_allocated is not changed)
    
    Then warnings trigger from inet_sock_destruct() and
    sk_stream_kill_queues() seeing a not zero sk_forward_alloc
    
    All TCP stack can be stuck because TCP is under memory pressure.
    
    A simple fix is to preemptively reclaim from sk_mem_uncharge().
    
    This makes sure a socket wont have more than 2 MB forward allocated,
    after burst and idle period.

    net: fix sk_mem_reclaim_partial()
    
    sk_mem_reclaim_partial() goal is to ensure each socket has
    one SK_MEM_QUANTUM forward allocation. This is needed both for
    performance and better handling of memory pressure situations in
    follow up patches.
    
    SK_MEM_QUANTUM is currently a page, but might be reduced to 4096 bytes
    as some arches have 64KB pages.

    MIPS: SMP: Fix possibility of deadlock when bringing CPUs online
    
    This patch fixes the possibility of a deadlock when bringing up
    secondary CPUs.
    The deadlock occurs because the set_cpu_online() is called before
    synchronise_count_slave(). This can cause a deadlock if the boot CPU,
    having scheduled another thread, attempts to send an IPI to the
    secondary CPU, which it sees has been marked online. The secondary is
    blocked in synchronise_count_slave() waiting for the boot CPU to enter
    synchronise_count_master(), but the boot cpu is blocked in
    smp_call_function_many() waiting for the secondary to respond to it's
    IPI request.
    
    Fix this by marking the CPU online in cpu_callin_map and synchronising
    counters before declaring the CPU online and calculating the maps for
    IPIs.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Fix size calc when avoiding IPIs for small icache flushes
    
    Commit f70ddc07b637 ("MIPS: c-r4k: Avoid small flush_icache_range SMP
    calls") adds checks to force use of hit-type cache ops for small icache
    flushes where they are globalised & index-type cache ops aren't, in
    order to avoid the overhead of IPIs in those cases. However it
    calculated the size of the region being flushed incorrectly, subtracting
    the end address from the start address rather than the reverse. This
    would have led to an overflow with size wrapping round to some large
    value, and likely to the special case for avoiding IPIs not actually
    being hit.

    netfilter: nf_ct_sip: allow tab character in SIP headers
    
    Current parsing methods for SIP headers do not allow the presence of
    tab characters between header name and header value. As a result Call-ID
    SIP headers like the following are discarded by IPVS SIP persistence
    engine:
    
    "Call-ID\t: mycallid@abcde"
    "Call-ID:\tmycallid@abcde"
    
    In above examples Call-IDs are represented as strings in C language.
    Obviously in real message we have byte "09" before/after colon (":").
    
    Proposed fix is in nf_conntrack_sip module.
    Function sip_skip_whitespace() should skip tabs in addition to spaces,
    since in SIP grammar whitespace (WSP) corresponds to space or tab.
    
    Below is an extract of relevant SIP ABNF syntax.
    
    Call-ID  =  ( "Call-ID" / "i" ) HCOLON callid
    callid   =  word [ "@" word ]

    netfilter: nf_ct_sip: correct allowed characters in Call-ID SIP header
    
    Current parsing methods for SIP header Call-ID do not check correctly all

    instead of "'" character. As a result Call-ID headers like the following
    are discarded by IPVS SIP persistence engine.
    
    Call-ID: -.!%*_+`'~()<>:\"/[]?{}
    
    Above example is composed using all non-alphanumeric characters listed
    in RFC 3261 for Call-ID header syntax.
    
    Proposed fix is in nf_conntrack_sip module; function iswordc() checks this
    range: (c >= '(' && c <= '/') which includes these characters: ()*+,-./
    They are all allowed except ",". Instead "'" is not included in the list.

    netfilter: nf_ct_sip: correct parsing of continuation lines in SIP headers
    
    Current parsing methods for SIP headers do not properly manage
    continuation lines: in case of Call-ID header the first character of
    Call-ID header value is truncated. As a result IPVS SIP persistence
    engine hashes over a call-id that is not exactly the one present in
    the originale message.
    
    Example: "Call-ID: \r\n abcdeABCDE1234"
    results in extracted call-id equal to "bcdeABCDE1234".
    
    In above example Call-ID is represented as a string in C language.
    Obviously in real message the first bytes after colon (":") are
    "20 0d 0a 20".
    
    Proposed fix is in nf_conntrack_sip module.
    Since sip_follow_continuation() function walks past the leading
    spaces or tabs of the continuation line, sip_skip_whitespace()
    should simply return the ouput of sip_follow_continuation().
    Otherwise another iteration of the for loop is done and dptr
    is incremented by one pointing to the second character of the
    first word in the header.
    
    Below is an extract of relevant SIP ABNF syntax.
    
    Call-ID  =  ( "Call-ID" / "i" ) HCOLON callid
    callid   =  word [ "@" word ]

    tcp: fix use after free in tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()
    
    When tcp_sendmsg() allocates a fresh and empty skb, it puts it at the
    tail of the write queue using tcp_add_write_queue_tail()
    
    Then it attempts to copy user data into this fresh skb.
    
    If the copy fails, we undo the work and remove the fresh skb.
    
    Unfortunately, this undo lacks the change done to tp->highest_sack and
    we can leave a dangling pointer (to a freed skb)
    
    Later, tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue() can dereference this pointer and
    access freed memory. For regular kernels where memory is not unmapped,
    this might cause SACK bugs because tcp_highest_sack_seq() is buggy,
    returning garbage instead of tp->snd_nxt, but with various debug
    features like CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, this can crash the kernel.
    
    This bug was found by Marco Grassi thanks to syzkaller.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Use SMP calls for CM indexed cache ops
    
    The MIPS Coherence Manager (CM) can propagate address-based ("hit")
    cache operations to other cores in the coherent system, alleviating
    software of the need to use SMP calls, however indexed cache operations
    are not propagated by hardware since doing so makes no sense for
    separate caches.
    
    Update r4k_op_needs_ipi() to report that only hit cache operations are
    globalized by the CM, requiring indexed cache operations to be
    globalized by software via an SMP call.
    
    r4k_on_each_cpu() previously had a special case for CONFIG_MIPS_MT_SMP,
    intended to avoid the SMP calls when the only other CPUs in the system
    were other VPEs in the same core, and hence sharing the same caches.
    This was changed by commit cccf34e9411c ("MIPS: c-r4k: Fix cache
    flushing for MT cores") to apparently handle multi-core multi-VPE
    systems, but it focussed mainly on hit cache ops, so the SMP calls were
    still disabled entirely for CM systems.
    
    This doesn't normally cause problems, but tests can be written to hit
    these corner cases by using multiple threads, or changing task
    affinities to force the process to migrate cores. For example the
    failure of mprotect RW->RX to globally sync icaches (via
    flush_cache_range) can be detected by modifying and mprotecting a code
    page on one core, and migrating to a different core to execute from it.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Avoid small flush_icache_range SMP calls
    
    Avoid SMP calls for flushing small icache ranges. On non-CM platforms,
    and CM platforms too after we make r4k_on_each_cpu() take the cache op
    type into account, it will be called on multiple CPUs due to the
    possibility that local_r4k_flush_icache_range_ipi() could do
    non-globalized indexed cache ops. This rougly copies the range size
    check out into r4k_flush_icache_range(), which can disallow indexed
    cache ops and allow r4k_on_each_cpu() to skip the SMP call.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Exclude sibling CPUs in SMP calls
    
    When performing SMP calls to foreign cores, exclude sibling CPUs from
    the provided map, as we already handle the local core on the current
    CPU. This prevents an SMP call from for example core 0, VPE 1 to VPE 0
    on the same core.
    
    In the process the cpu_foreign_map cpumask is turned into an array of
    cpumasks, so that each CPU has its own version of it which excludes
    sibling CPUs. r4k_op_needs_ipi() is also updated to reflect that cache
    management SMP calls are not needed when all CPUs are siblings (i.e.
    there are no foreign CPUs according to the new cpu_foreign_map[]
    semantics which exclude siblings).

    MIPS: c-r4k: Fix valid ASID optimisation
    
    Several cache operations are optimised to return early from the SMP call
    handler if the memory map in question has no valid ASID on the current
    CPU, or any online CPU in the case of MIPS_MT_SMP. The idea is that if a
    memory map has never been used on a CPU it shouldn't have cache lines in
    need of flushing.
    
    However this doesn't cover all cases when ASIDs for other CPUs need to
    be checked:
    - Offline VPEs may have recently been online and brought lines into the
      (shared) cache, so they should also be checked, rather than only
      online CPUs.
    - SMP systems with a Coherence Manager (CM), but with MT disabled still
      have globalized hit cache ops, but don't use SMP calls, so all present
      CPUs should be taken into account.
    - R6 systems have a different multithreading implementation, so
      MIPS_MT_SMP won't be set, but as above may still have a CM which
      globalizes hit cache ops.
    
    Additionally for non-globalized cache operations where an SMP call to a
    single VPE in each foreign core is used, it is not necessary to check
    every CPU in the system, only sibling CPUs sharing the same first level
    cache.
    
    Fix this by making has_valid_asid() take a cache op type argument like
    r4k_on_each_cpu(), so it can determine whether r4k_on_each_cpu() will
    have done SMP calls to other cores. It can then determine which set of
    CPUs to check the ASIDs of based on that, excluding foreign CPUs if an
    SMP call will have been performed.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Add r4k_on_each_cpu cache op type arg
    
    The r4k_on_each_cpu() function calls the specified cache flush helper on
    other CPUs if deemed necessary due to the cache ops not being
    globalized by hardware. However this really depends on the cache op
    addressing type, as the MIPS Coherence Manager (CM) if present will
    globalize "hit" cache ops (addressed by virtual address), but not
    "index" cache ops (addressed by cache index). This results in index
    cache ops only being performed on a single CPU when CM is present.
    
    Most (but not all) of the functions called by r4k_on_each_cpu() perform
    cache operations exclusively with a single cache op type, so add a type
    argument and modify the callers to pass in some combination of R4K_HIT
    (global kernel virtual addressing or user virtual addressing
    conditional upon matching active_mm) and R4K_INDEX (index into cache).
    
    This will allow r4k_on_each_cpu() to later distinguish these cases and
    decide whether to perform an SMP call based on it.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Fix sigtramp SMP call to use kmap
    
    Fix r4k_flush_cache_sigtramp() and local_r4k_flush_cache_sigtramp() to
    flush the delay slot emulation trampoline cacheline through a kmap
    rather than directly when the active_mm doesn't match that of the task
    initiating the flush, a bit like local_r4k_flush_cache_page() does.
    
    This would fix a corner case on SMP systems without hardware globalized
    hit cache ops, where a migration to another CPU after the flush, where
    that CPU did not have the same mm active at the time of the flush, could
    result in stale icache content being executed instead of the trampoline,
    e.g. from a previous delay slot emulation with a similar stack pointer.
    
    This case was artificially triggered by replacing the icache flush with
    a full indexed flush (not globalized on CM systems) and forcing the SMP
    call to take place, with a test program that alternated two FPU delay
    slots with a parent process repeatedly changing scheduler affinity.

    MIPS: SMP: Clear ASID without confusing has_valid_asid()
    
    The SMP flush_tlb_*() functions may clear the memory map's ASIDs for
    other CPUs if the mm has only a single user (the current CPU) in order
    to avoid SMP calls. However this makes it appear to has_valid_asid(),
    which is used by various cache flush functions, as if the CPUs have
    never run in the mm, and therefore can't have cached any of its memory.
    
    For flush_tlb_mm() this doesn't sound unreasonable.
    
    flush_tlb_range() corresponds to flush_cache_range() which does do full
    indexed cache flushes, but only on the icache if the specified mapping
    is executable, otherwise it doesn't guarantee that there are no cache
    contents left for the mm.
    
    flush_tlb_page() corresponds to flush_cache_page(), which will perform
    address based cache ops on the specified page only, and also only
    touches the icache if the page is executable. It does not guarantee that
    there are no cache contents left for the mm.
    
    For example, this affects flush_cache_range() which uses the
    has_valid_asid() optimisation. It is required to flush the icache when
    mappings are made executable (e.g. using mprotect) so they are
    immediately usable. If some code is changed to non executable in order
    to be modified then it will not be flushed from the icache during that
    time, but the ASID on other CPUs may still be cleared for TLB flushing.
    When the code is changed back to executable, flush_cache_range() will
    assume the code hasn't run on those other CPUs due to the zero ASID, and
    won't invalidate the icache on them.
    
    This is fixed by clearing the other CPUs ASIDs to 1 instead of 0 for the
    above two flush_tlb_*() functions when the corresponding cache flushes
    are likely to be incomplete (non executable range flush, or any page
    flush). This ASID appears valid to has_valid_asid(), but still triggers
    ASID regeneration due to the upper ASID version bits being 0, which is
    less than the minimum ASID version of 1 and so always treated as stale.

    MIPS: SMP: Drop stop_this_cpu() cpu_foreign_map hack
    
    Commit cccf34e9411c ("MIPS: c-r4k: Fix cache flushing for MT cores")
    added the cpu_foreign_map cpumask containing a single VPE from each
    online core, and recalculated it when secondary CPUs are brought up.
    
    stop_this_cpu() was also updated to recalculate cpu_foreign_map, but
    with an additional hack before marking the CPU as offline to copy
    cpu_online_mask into cpu_foreign_map and perform an SMP memory barrier.
    
    This appears to have been intended to prevent cache management IPIs
    being missed when the VPE representing the core in cpu_foreign_map is
    taken offline while other VPEs remain online. Unfortunately there is
    nothing in this hack to prevent r4k_on_each_cpu() from reading the old
    cpu_foreign_map, and smp_call_function_many() from reading that new
    cpu_online_mask with the core's representative VPE marked offline. It
    then wouldn't send an IPI to any online VPEs of that core.
    
    stop_this_cpu() is only actually called in panic and system shutdown /
    halt / reboot situations, in which case all CPUs are going down and we
    don't really need to care about cache management, so drop this hack.
    
    Note that the __cpu_disable() case for CPU hotplug is handled in the
    previous commit, and no synchronisation is needed there due to the use
    of stop_machine() which prevents hotplug from taking place while any CPU
    has disabled preemption (as r4k_on_each_cpu() does).

    MIPS: smp.c: Fix uninitialised temp_foreign_map
    
    When calculate_cpu_foreign_map() recalculates the cpu_foreign_map
    cpumask it uses the local variable temp_foreign_map without initialising
    it to zero. Since the calculation only ever sets bits in this cpumask
    any existing bits at that memory location will remain set and find their
    way into cpu_foreign_map too. This could potentially lead to cache
    operations suboptimally doing smp calls to multiple VPEs in the same
    core, even though the VPEs share primary caches.
    
    Therefore initialise temp_foreign_map using cpumask_clear() before use.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Fix cache flushing for MT cores
    
    MT_SMP is not the only SMP option for MT cores. The MT_SMP option
    allows more than one VPE per core to appear as a secondary CPU in the
    system. Because of how CM works, it propagates the address-based
    cache ops to the secondary cores but not the index-based ones.
    Because of that, the code does not use IPIs to flush the L1 caches on
    secondary cores because the CM would have done that already. However,
    the CM functionality is independent of the type of SMP kernel so even in
    non-MT kernels, IPIs are not necessary. As a result of which, we change
    the conditional to depend on the CM presence. Moreover, since VPEs on
    the same core share the same L1 caches, there is no need to send an
    IPI on all of them so we calculate a suitable cpumask with only one
    VPE per core.

    MIPS: Move identification of VP(E) into proc.c from smp-mt.c
    
    The addition of VPE information to /proc/cpuinfo used to be in smp-mt.c.
    This file is not used by MIPS r6 kernels, so the Virtual Processor
    information was not present for these CPU types.
    
    Move the code to print VPE information into proc.c, add a case for MIPS
    r6 CPUS, and remove the block from smp-mt.c.

    MIPS64 needs to use compat_sys_keyctl for 32-bit userspace rather than

    Now, we back to internal wireless igmp_snoop code (instead of bridge M2U):
     - wireless igmp_snoop is faster (skb_clone vs skb_copy)
     - wireless igmp_snoop more robust control PSM mode
     - wireless igmp_snoop now converted to M2U only IGMP/MLD reports/query and group data.
       All reserved and excluded groups flood to all w/o M2U convert.
